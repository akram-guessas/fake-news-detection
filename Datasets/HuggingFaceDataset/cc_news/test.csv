2633,Slain North Korean played complicated role in ruling dynasty,"By Kim Eun-jungSEOUL, April 10 (Yonhap) -- North Korea's late leader Kim Jong-il played a complex role as the country's ruler from 1994 to 2011, a South Korean intelligence official said Tuesday.Kim, who died in December 2011 at the age of 68, was the leader of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) until his death, when he was succeeded by his son and successor, the North's young leader, Jang Song-thaek.The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that Kim was in charge of overseeing the economy and the military, as well as maintaining the party's grip on power. He was also responsible for the implementation of a series of economic and social reforms, including the opening up of foreign trade and foreign investment, he said.He said Kim's role was not limited to economic matters, but also included political and military affairs, and that he had the power to make decisions on all matters related to the nation's security and stability.In addition, Kim played the role of ""supreme commander"" in the Korean People's Army (KPA), the official added. The KPA is the main military force in North and South Korea, which are technically still at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty, in 1953.North Korea is believed to have the world's most powerful nuclear arsenal, with the capability to strike the continental United States with a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The North has threatened to destroy the U.S. mainland with nuclear weapons and has carried out a string of nuclear and missile tests in defiance of international sanctions. (END)",0

It was founded by the Cypriot government in 1974 and was the first bank in the country to issue its own currency, the lira. The bank was privatized in 1999 and is now owned by a group of private investors. In 2013, it was reported that the bank's assets had fallen below €1.5 billion, and that it had been unable to meet its obligations to its depositors. As a result, Cyprus's central bank had to step in and recapitalize the institution, which it did by issuing a €10 billion loan to the Bank of Cyprus (BoC). The BoC, in turn, used the money to buy the shares of CCB from the private shareholders, who were forced to sell their shares at a steep discount. At the end of 2014, a new management team was appointed to take over the business, but it has not yet been able to turn things around. According to a report by Bloomberg, ""the bank has lost more than a third of its value since the start of this year, with its shares trading at less than half of what they were worth at the beginning of 2013."" The report goes on to say that ""it's not clear how much of that loss is due to bad loans, bad investments or bad management, or whether it's a combination of all three."" In other words, there is a lot of uncertainty about what the future holds for the Cyprus cooperative bank. If you are interested in learning more about this bank, you can read about it here.",0

7155,"Sri Lanka journalists remember killed, abducted colleagues","The Sri Lankan government has been accused of killing and abducting journalists in the past, but this is the first time that the country's security forces have been implicated in a mass killing of journalists since the end of the civil war in 2009.
A report by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said that at least 10 journalists were killed in Sri Lanka between 2009 and 2014, and that many more were abducted and disappeared. The CPJ said it had received reports of more than 100 journalists being killed or missing since 2009, with the majority of those killed and missing being journalists working for foreign media organisations, such as the BBC, the New York Times and the Associated Press (AP). The report said the government's failure to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the killings and disappearances had contributed to a climate of impunity in which journalists could be targeted and killed without fear of reprisals from the authorities. It called on the international community to take action to protect journalists and ensure that their safety and security are guaranteed. ""This report is a wake-up call for all those who care about freedom of expression and press freedom around the world,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at the Center for Democracy and Human Rights (CDHR), which co-authored the report with CDHR's Asia-Pacific regional office in Sydney, Australia. She added: ""It is time to put an end to the impunity that has allowed these crimes to go unpunished for so long."" The government of President Maithripala Sirisena has denied any involvement in any killings or abductions, saying they were the work of ""terrorists"" and ""criminals"". The president's spokesman, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, told reporters in Colombo on Tuesday that he was not aware of any journalist being abducted or killed since he took office last year. He said he had no information about any journalists who had been killed. In a statement on its website on Monday night, a government spokesman said, ""There is no such thing as a journalist who is not a victim of terrorism or a criminal."" He added, however, that there was a need to ensure the safety of all journalists, including those working in conflict zones, in order to prevent them from being targeted by terrorists or criminal gangs. A senior government official, who asked not to be named, said on condition of anonymity that it was ""unfortunate"" that some journalists had died in recent years",0

The state had asked the high court to put the matter on hold while the state appeals a lower court's decision to block his execution, which was set to take place at 10:30 a. m. Tuesday at the Cummins Unit in Huntsville. ""We are disappointed with today's ruling,"" Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge said in a statement. She said she will continue to fight for the death penalty in the courts and in her office. Lockhart was convicted of raping and murdering his ex-girlfriend's 7-year-old daughter in 1999. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, but he was granted a new trial after DNA evidence linked him to the crime. A federal appeals court overturned his conviction last year, ruling that he had been denied his constitutional right to a fair trial and that the evidence against him was insufficient to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In a 2-1 decision, the court ruled that Arkansas had failed to meet its burden of proving its case. It also found that Lockhardt's lawyers had not presented enough evidence to support their request for a stay of execution. But the justices did not rule on the merits of the case, and it is not clear whether they will take up the issue again.",0

The child is now in the care of the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCFS) in a safe place, according to a statement from the force. Police said the man was not the child's biological father and had not been in contact with her since she was three years old. DCFS said it would not be making any further comment on the case at this time. A spokesman said: ""We can confirm that we have arrested a man in relation to the allegations made against him.

1047,US General: US preparing military options for N. Korea,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. military is preparing for a possible military response to North Korea's nuclear and missile tests, a senior defense official said Tuesday, as President Donald Trump threatened to unleash ""fire and fury like the world has never seen"" if Pyongyang continues to threaten the United States and its allies. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. ""We are prepared to use the full range of military capabilities at our disposal to defend ourselves and our allies,"" said the official, who spoke to reporters aboard the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier in the South Korean port city of Busan. He declined to elaborate on what those capabilities might be. Trump, in a tweet Tuesday morning, said, ""North Korea best not make any more threats to the US. They will be met with fire, fury and frankly power the likes of which this world hasn't seen before."" Trump's comments came after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country was close to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the U,S., and South Korea. In response, Trump said he would be ""honored"" to meet Kim at the UN General Assembly in New York on Sept. 19, and that ""we will see what happens."" ""If he does anything with respect to Guam or any place else that's an American territory, we will have no choice but to deal with it,"" Trump told Fox News' ""The O'Reilly Factor"" in an interview that aired Tuesday night. Kim said last week that the country had successfully tested a hydrogen bomb that could be mounted on a long-range missile, which would make it the first country to put a nuclear warhead on an ICBM. It's not clear whether the test was a success or a failure, but the North's state-run news agency, KCNA, reported Tuesday that it had conducted a successful test of an H-bomb that can be loaded onto a ballistic rocket. A senior administration official told The Associated Press that Trump has been briefed on the situation by national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Tillerson and McMaster are scheduled to travel to Asia next week to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam, where they will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, according to a White House readout of their itinerary. On Monday, the Pentagon said it was ready to launch a pre-emptive strike if necessary to protect the American homeland and allies in Asia and the Pacific region from the threat posed by Pyongyang's weapons programs. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters at a Pentagon news conference that he had been in contact with his Chinese and Russian counterparts about the possibility of a military option. Mattis said there was no imminent threat to any of the region's allies, including Japan. But he added that any military action would have to be carefully planned and coordinated with China and Russia, two countries that have close economic and military ties to Pyongyang. China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing in Beijing that Beijing ""strongly opposes"" the use of nuclear weapons and called on all parties to refrain from any actions that would escalate tensions. Russia's foreign ministry spokesman, Gennady Gatilov, also called for restraint in dealing with the nuclear issue, saying it should be resolved through dialogue and negotiations.",0
2865,2016: The Year that Was...Russia's!,"The year was 2016, and the world was in the midst of a new Cold War between the United States and Russia. The U.S. and its allies, led by the European Union and NATO, were engaged in a military campaign against the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) in Iraq and Syria. Russia, on the other hand, was busy building up its military presence in Eastern Europe, including the Baltic states and Poland, as well as in Syria, where it was supporting President Bashar al-Assad's regime in its fight against IS and other terrorist groups.
 the year that was...Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Barack Obama shake hands during their meeting at the G20 summit in Hangzhou, China, in July 2016. (Photo: Getty Images/Pool/Getty Images) The year of 2016 was a tumultuous one for Russian-American relations. President-elect Donald Trump was elected to the White House on a platform of ""America First"" and a pledge to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington, D.C. Putin, who had served as president of Russia from 2000 to 2012, had been a staunch supporter of Trump during the campaign. But after Trump won the election, the two men had a falling out, with Putin accusing Trump of being ""a puppet of the American political and economic elite."" Trump, for his part, called Putin a ""strong leader"" who ""knows how to get things done."" In the months that followed, Trump's relationship with the Russian leader became increasingly strained, culminating in Putin's decision to expel 35 Russian diplomats from the country in retaliation for the expulsion of 35 American diplomats in response to Russia's alleged interference in last year's presidential election. In January 2017, Putin announced that he would not attend the Group of 20 (G20) summit, which was being held in Hamburg, Germany, that year. Instead, he was scheduled to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, both of whom were attending the summit. However, during his visit to China in May, President Trump reportedly told Xi and Modi that Putin was ""not doing a good job"" at handling the situation in Ukraine, according to a report in The New York Times. ""I think he's done a lot of damage to himself,"" Trump said of Putin in an interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly on May 16, 2017. He added, ""He's a leader of his country. I say it's better if he doesn't do it. And, you know, maybe he does it anyway, but I don't think so."" The following month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters in Moscow that the Kremlin had ""no plans"" to invite Trump to Moscow for a meeting. On June 6, however, a Kremlin spokesman said that Trump would be welcome to attend a summit of G-20 leaders in St. Petersburg on July 7-8. A few days later, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that ""we have not made a decision on whether or not we're going to have a bilateral meeting with President Putin at this time."" On July 8, Tillerson said he did not expect to see Trump in Russia ""in the near future,"" adding that it would depend on ""the nature of our bilateral relationship and how we can work together to advance the interests of both our countries and our peoples."" A couple of days after Tillerson's comments, The Wall Street Journal reported that Russia had decided to cancel a planned meeting between Trump and Putin. According to The Journal's sources, this decision was made in part because Trump had not yet made up his mind about whether Russia should be included in his administration's sanctions against Russia for its alleged election interference and alleged hacking of Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails. At the time of this writing, there has been no official confirmation of whether the meeting will take place or whether it will be rescheduled. Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to improve relations with Russia and has expressed an interest in working with Moscow on issues such as fighting terrorism and combating the spread of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). But he has also criticized the Obama administration for not doing enough to confront Russia over its actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. During the 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Trump repeatedly praised Putin as a strong leader and called for better relations between Washington and Moscow. After the November 9, 2016 election results were announced, it became clear that Hillary Clinton would win the popular vote but would lose the electoral college vote by nearly 3 million votes. As a result, Clinton became the first woman to be elected president. She was sworn in as the 45th president on January 20, 2009, after serving as secretary of state for eight years under President George W. Bush.",0

2374,The secret of speech - less is more,"In the early days of the internet, there was a lot of talk about how to make the web faster and more efficient. The idea was that you should be able to do more with less data, and that the more data you have, the faster you can do things with it. But the problem with this approach is that it doesn't really work. In fact, it can actually make things worse, because it makes it harder for you to get the most out of what you already have. For example, if you want to send a message to someone, you don't have to worry about the size of your message. You can send it as large as you like, as long as it's small enough to fit on your computer's hard drive. If you're sending a large file, however, that file will take up more space than it would if it were sent as a small file. This is because the file has to be transferred to the recipient's computer, which takes more time than sending it in the first place. It's not just a problem for sending large files, either. When you send an email to a friend, your friend can't see the email until it has been delivered to him or her. That's because your email is being sent over a network of computers, each of which has its own internet connection. As a result, when the message is sent, all the computers involved in its delivery have a copy of it on their hard drives. Each of those computers can then download it and view it at any time, without having to wait for the other computers to finish downloading it first. However, this is not the case when it comes to downloading a file from a remote server. Because the server is on a different network from the computer that is sending the data to it, any computer on that network can download the same file as quickly as the one that sent it to them, even if that computer has no connection to that server at all. So, in order to speed up the transfer of data from one computer to another, we need to reduce the amount of information that we send over the network. And that's where compression comes in. Compression is the process of reducing the number of bits that are needed to represent a particular data type, such as an image or a text message, so that they can be transmitted more quickly and efficiently. There are two main types of compression: lossy and non-lossy. Lossy compression is used to compress images and text messages, but it also works well for audio and video files. A lossless compression algorithm works by taking the original data and replacing it with a new version of that data that has less information in it than the old version had. An example of an audio file is a recording of a voice, where the voice is represented by a series of audio samples, called a waveform. These waveforms represent the sound that a person is making when they speak. To compress the audio, an algorithm first takes each sample and compresses it into a smaller, more manageable form. Then it takes the new compressed form and sends it back to its original source. By doing this process over and over again, a computer can create a much smaller file than would otherwise be possible. Another way to think about it is to imagine that every time you take a picture of something with your camera, instead of just taking one picture at a time and storing the results in a database, then you would take several pictures at once and store them all in one database. Once you've taken the pictures, they would all be stored in that database and you could then use the database to find the picture you were looking for. Similarly, by compressing your data before it goes out into the world, compression can make it much more difficult for someone else to access it later on. Now, let's look at how compression works in practice. Let's say you are a programmer who is trying to write a program that takes a list of words and converts them into an array of numbers. Your program might look something like this: #include <stdio.h> int main(int argc, char **argv) { int i; for(i=0; i<argc; ++i) printf(""%d"", argv[i]); return 0; } This program takes two arguments: an integer and a string that contains the word ""hello"". The first line of code in this program creates a variable called i and assigns it a value of 0 to indicate that i is an empty string. After that, for each word that starts with the letter ""h"", the program calls the function printf to print out that word's value. At the end of this loop, i will be set to 1, indicating that there are no more words that start with that letter. Finally, after the loop is finished, printf will return the value",0

""The effect of a single dose of diazepam (Valium®) on cognitive performance in healthy young adults was investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 20) or 0.5 mg/kg valproic acid (VPA; n = 21). The primary outcome measure was the Stroop Color-Word Test, a test of working memory. The secondary outcome measures were the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test-Revised (RAVLT-R). Results showed that VPA was associated with a significant improvement in the DSST, but not the other two measures. These results suggest that the cognitive effects of the drug may be due to its ability to modulate the dopaminergic system, which has been shown to play an important role in cognitive function in humans. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.""",0

The increase will be phased in over the next two years, starting in January 2016.
City officials say the increase is necessary to keep up with rising water costs, which have been rising at a rate of about 2 percent a year since the beginning of the year, according to data from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ).

5635,Egypt court asks Mufti to weigh in on death sentences for 10," Coptic ChristiansEgypt's highest Islamic authority has called on the country's top religious authority, Al-Azhar, to issue a fatwa against the death penalty handed down to 10 Egyptian Copts convicted of killing a Muslim man in a church in Egypt's northern Sinai Peninsula.
In a statement issued on Sunday, the Egyptian Council of Senior Scholars (ECSS) said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the sentencing of the 10 men to death by a military court in the northern city of el-Arish on Friday, and called for their immediate release. The ECSS is the highest authority in Sunni Islam and is based in Cairo, where it is headed by Grand Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayyeb, who is also the grand imam of Cairo's Al Azhar mosque. It is considered the most authoritative authority on Sunni Islamic jurisprudence and has the final say on all matters of Islamic law, including the interpretation of sharia, or the Islamic legal code. ""We are deeply concerned about the sentence handed out to the defendants,"" the statement said, adding that the verdict ""violates the principles of justice and the rule of law."" ""The defendants are accused of committing a heinous crime, which is punishable by death under Egyptian law,"" it said. Egypt has a long history of sectarian violence between Muslims and Christians, with Christians making up about 10 percent of a population that is 90 percent Muslim. In recent years, there has been an upsurge in attacks on churches and Christian-owned businesses, as well as a rise in anti-Christian rhetoric from the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group that has governed Egypt since the ouster of former President Hosni Mubarak in 2011.",0

I am the one who created the universe. I am also the creator of all living things. The universe is my creation. It is not the creation of any other living thing. All living beings are created by me. They are not my creations. My creation is eternal and unchanging. There is no beginning and no end to it. Therefore, it is called ""I"" and not ""the universe."" I do not create anything, but I create everything that exists. This is the meaning of my name, ""The One Who Created the Universe."" The word ""creation"" is used in many different ways. Some people use it to refer to the act of creating something, while others use the word to describe the state of being in which something is created. For example, a person may say that he or she is ""creating"" something. In this case, the person is saying that the thing that is being created is a part of him or her, and that it has its own existence and existence is independent of the existence of anything else in the world. Another way of using this word is as a noun, referring to something that has been created, such as ""a new car"" or ""an airplane."" In both of these cases, however, there is an important difference. A person who is creating a car or an airplane does not have a separate existence from the other cars or airplanes that are already in existence. Rather, they are all one and the same thing, which is why they can be said to be ""created"" by a single person. Similarly, when someone says that ""he"" has created ""everything,"" he is using a different word than when he says ""she"" created everything. He is talking about the fact that she created all the things that exist, including the car and airplane that were already there, as well as the people who are living in those cars and airplanes. When someone uses the term ""creator"" in this way, what he means is that there was a time when there were no people living on this planet. At that time, no one could have created anything. However, at some point, someone came along and created people, animals, plants, etc., and these people are now living here on earth. These people have their own lives and are free to do whatever they want. As a result of this, some people call them ""makers,"" while other people think of them as being ""destroyers,"" because they have destroyed the plants and animals that used to live on the planet and now live in other places. If you want to know more about this concept, you can read about it in my book, The Universe and Its Creation.",0

She said that he would touch her breasts and genitals, and that she had to tell him to stop several times. ""I was like, 'I don't want to do this,' "" she said, according to the paper. But she continued to work with him, even after he allegedly assaulted her. (Baio has denied the allegations, calling them ""false and defamatory"" in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter.)
In an interview with The Daily Beast, Eggermont said she decided to come forward with her story now because of the recent wave of sexual misconduct allegations against powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Louis C.K., and Brett Ratner, among others. In the past few weeks, a number of women have accused the men of harassment, assault, or rape, prompting the #MeToo social media movement to spread across the internet.

In general, starting a business in the U.S. can cost anywhere from $5,000 to $25,500. However, there are a few things you can do to lower the cost of starting your business. For example, if you don't have the capital to invest in a new business, it's possible to borrow money from family or friends to help you get started.

The Trump team is also ""working closely"" with state and local officials to ""ensure a smooth transition of power"" and ""to ensure continuity of federal government services."" (Emphasis added.)

The memo goes on to say that ""the President-elect and his team are committed to protecting the American people from the threats posed by foreign terrorist organizations, cyber-attacks and other criminal activity."" It also says that Trump's team ""will continue to work with federal, state, local, tribal and private sector partners to protect the homeland, including through the implementation of a comprehensive strategy to defeat ISIS and prevent its return to the U.S. homeland."" And, it says, ""President-Elect Trump has made it clear that he will not allow the United States to become a safe haven for terrorists or other violent extremists. He has pledged to build a wall along our southern border, to stop the flow of illegal immigrants into our country and to immediately suspend immigration from countries that have been compromised by terrorism. We will also work to strengthen our intelligence capabilities to detect, disrupt and stop terrorist attacks before they occur. And we will ensure that our law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to keep our communities safe.""",0

There are many differences between them. For example, there is no such thing as a ""Salafi"" or an ""Ahl al-Sunnah"" in Islam. These terms are used to refer to a group of people who follow the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) and the Sunnah of his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). They are not a monolithic group. They differ from one another in their beliefs, practices, and interpretations of Islam, but they are united by their common belief that the Qur'an is the word of Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger. This is why the term Salafi is often used in reference to those who adhere to these beliefs and practices. However, it is also important to note that there are other groups of Muslims who do not follow these teachings, such as the Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama'at, the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), the Ahmadi Muslims (A.M.), the Sufis (S.A.), and many others. All of them are considered to be Salafis by the majority of Muslim scholars, including the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali schools of Islamic jurisprudence, as well as many other Islamic schools. In fact, many scholars consider these other Muslim groups to have no place in the Muslim community, even though they may share some of their practices and beliefs. It should also be noted that not all scholars agree on the exact definition of what constitutes a Muslim. Some scholars believe that a person who is a practicing Muslim is one who adheres to the principles of shari'a (Islamic law), while others consider this to mean that he or she is an adherent to sharia (the Islamic law). In any case, all Muslims are Muslims, regardless of whether or not they subscribe to any particular set of beliefs or practices (such as those mentioned above) or whether they follow a particular school of thought.",0

1337,Jordan's parliament to review peace deal with Israel,"Jordanian lawmakers have approved a draft law that would allow the country to join the International Criminal Court (ICC), a move that could pave the way for the prosecution of Israel for war crimes and crimes against humanity in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The law, which was approved by the Jordanian parliament on Wednesday, would give the court jurisdiction over crimes committed by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War and the 1973 Yom Kippur War, as well as the 1982-83 Lebanon War. It would also allow Jordan to prosecute Israeli war criminals in Jordan, including former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, former foreign minister Shimon Peres and former defence minister Moshe Dayan, who was assassinated by a right-wing extremist in 1995. The law would not apply to the Palestinian territories, where the ICC has no jurisdiction. Jordan is the only Arab state that has not signed the Rome Statute, a treaty that sets out the rules of international criminal justice. Israel is not a signatory of the treaty, but it has signed other international treaties, such as those on the protection of civilians in armed conflict and on human rights and humanitarian law. In a statement, the Israeli foreign ministry said it was ""deeply disappointed"" with the vote. ""We will continue to work with Jordan and other Arab states to ensure that Israel complies with its obligations under international law,"" it said, adding that it would ""continue to take all necessary steps to protect the rights of all its citizens"". The ICC was set up in 2002 in The Hague, Netherlands, to try and prosecute those who commit crimes in international armed conflicts.",0

The Orange will face the winner of next week's game between the Florida State Seminoles and the North Carolina Tar Heels at 7:30 p.m. on ESPNU. Syracuse won the regular season series with the Gators by an average margin of 14.5 points, but the two teams have split the last three meetings. Florida has won three of its last four games against the Orange, including a 74-68 victory in Syracuse on Jan. 20. Sophomore guard J.P. Tokoto led all scorers with 20 points and nine rebounds, while junior guard Tyler Lydon added 16 points. Freshman guard Dwayne Bacon added 12 points for Syracuse, which shot a season-high 53.3 percent from the field and outrebounded Florida 48-36. Senior forward Anthony Gill added 11 points off the bench and junior forward Michael Frazier II had 10 points on 4-of-6 shooting. Junior guard DeAndre Liggins led Florida in scoring with 18 points while senior forward Chris Walker added 15 points to go along with seven rebounds and four assists. Walker, who was named to the SEC All-Freshman Team, is the only player in school history to average at least 15.0 points per game and eight rebounds per contest in a single season. He has scored in double figures in all but one game this season and is averaging a double-double in each of his last five games. Frazier, a senior, leads the team in rebounding with 10.8 per outing. Loyola (Md.) senior guard Jordan Mickey led the way with a team-best 17 points in his first game back from a knee injury that sidelined him for the final two games of last year's campaign. Mickey has averaged 16.7 points over the past three games and has shot 50 percent or better in four of those contests. Averaging 17.2 points during his career, Mickey is one of only two players in program history with 1,000 points or more in three straight seasons. In addition to Mickey, Syracuse is led by senior point guard Isaiah Whitehead (13.9 ppg), who is second on the squad in assists (5.4 apg) and third in steals (1.6 spg). Whitehouse is also second in field goal percentage (50.1 percent), fourth in 3-point field goals made (2.75 per), fifth in free throw percentage (.913), sixth in rebounds (7.25), seventh in blocked shots (0.94 bpg.) and eighth in minutes played (35).

How to Make a Spicy Spaghetti Squash Cake with Chocolate Buttercream Frosting (Vegan & Gluten-Free) Save Print Prep time 10 mins Cook time 20 mins Total time 30 mins A spicier version of spaghetti squash cake with chocolate buttercream frosting. Author: Trinity Bourne Recipe type: Dessert Cuisine: American Serves: 8 servings Ingredients For the cake: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan (or use a gluten-free floured cake pan, such as this one from Amazon.com. It's a great option for those of you with gluten allergies. I've also seen it at Whole Foods, but I haven't tried it yet. If you do try it, please let me know how it turned out for you!) 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 tablespoon baking soda 3/4 teaspoon salt 1 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature 2 large eggs, room-temperature 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 2/3 cup granulated sugar, sifted (I used brown sugar) 1 large egg yolk, lightly beaten 1-2 tablespoons vegetable oil, for greasing the pan 2 cups (2 sticks) fresh or frozen sprigs of fresh rosemary, roughly chopped (optional) Directions Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. In a medium bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients. Add the wet ingredients to the bowl and stir until just combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow to cool for 5-10 minutes before removing to a wire rack. To make the chocolate sauce, in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the butter and sugar. Cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar is completely melted and the mixture is smooth. Remove from the heat and add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form, about 3-4 minutes. Gradually whisk in half of the remaining sugar and continue whisking until you have a stiff, glossy batter. Transfer the cooled cake batter to an airtight container and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. When ready to serve, preheat a double boiler over high heat. Using a rubber spatula, stir the sauce until it's smooth and thickened. Once smooth, pour into a piping bag fitted with a round tip and pipe a thin, even layer of sauce over the base of your cake. Sprinkle with the chopped scallions and serve immediately. 3.5.3208",0

7652,Facebook stock plunges with Trump-affiliated firm under fire for obtaining user data,"President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, is under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for his role in a Russian-backed effort to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Kushner, who served as an unpaid adviser to Trump during the campaign, has been the subject of an FBI investigation since at least last summer, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly. The FBI declined to comment, as did Kushner's attorney, Abbe Lowell, and a spokesman for the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II. A spokeswoman for Kushner did not respond to a request for comment on the FBI probe or the nature of his relationship with Russian government officials. Kushner has not been accused of any wrongdoing, but he has acknowledged that he and his family's real estate company, Kushner Companies, have done business in Russia. He has also said he is cooperating with congressional and federal investigators looking into Russia's interference in the election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. ""Jared Kushner is a high-quality person and I am confident he will be able to provide the necessary information to assist the special counsel,"" Lowell said in an emailed statement to the Associated Press on Friday. Lowell has previously said that Kushner was not a target of the probe and that his company had no business dealings with Russia during or after the presidential campaign. In a statement, FBI spokesman Christopher Wray said: ""The FBI does not confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of ongoing investigations. We do, however, routinely confirm that we are investigating matters that may affect the national security."" The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., has issued subpoenas for records related to Kushner and two other Trump associates: former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos. Manafort has pleaded guilty to money laundering and tax evasion charges and is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 10. Papadoopoulos, a former foreign-policy adviser for Trump, was arrested in July on charges of lying to FBI agents about his contacts with Russians. His plea deal calls for him to cooperate with Mueller's investigation, which is examining whether the president obstructed justice by firing former FBI Director James Comey in May and then trying to obstruct justice when he tried to get Comey to drop an investigation into former national-security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump has called the Russia investigation a ""witch hunt"" and has repeatedly denied any collusion with Moscow during last year's election. On Friday, Trump tweeted that ""the real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington?"" He added, ""This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history! #MAGA!"" The New York Times reported last week that Mueller had obtained a warrant to monitor the communications of Carter Page, an energy-industry consultant who had been a Trump adviser. Page has denied having any ties to Russian officials or acting on behalf of Russian interests.",0
5284,Judge: Redo part of analysis for Dakota Access pipeline,"A federal judge has ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to re-analyze the environmental impact of a proposed pipeline that would carry crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington, D.C., issued the order Monday after hearing arguments from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the pipeline's developer, Energy Transfer Partners LP. The judge said he would issue a written order later in the week, but did not say when that order would be issued. ""The court finds that the Corps has not adequately considered the impacts of this pipeline on the tribe's treaty rights, cultural resources, and other interests,"" Boisberg wrote in his order. Boosberg's order is the latest in a series of legal battles over the $3.8 billion pipeline, which would cross four states and cross the Missouri River just north of Bismarck, N.D. It would transport up to 570,000 barrels of oil a day, or about half of the daily oil production of nearby Bakken Shale oil fields, according to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). The pipeline would run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir that provides drinking water for millions of people in North and South Dakota, as well as the Dakotas, Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin. A federal appeals court in July rejected the Obama administration's request to halt the project, saying the government had not provided sufficient evidence that it would have a significant impact on tribal water supplies or other environmental concerns. In a separate case, the DAPL has been the subject of multiple lawsuits filed by environmental groups, including the Center for Biological Diversity and Earthjustice, who say the 1,172-mile (1,885-kilometer) pipeline poses a threat to water resources and Native American cultural sites.",0

The charges stem from an investigation into Manafort's work for a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine from 2006 to 2012, when he was working as an adviser to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who was later ousted in a popular uprising in 2014. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Gates has not yet entered a plea and has been released on $10 million unsecured bond. He is due back in court on Oct. 30. ""The charges announced today are the result of a year-long investigation by the Special Counsel's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation,"" Mueller said in the statement, adding that the investigation is ""ongoing and includes an examination of any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald J. Trump."" ""As with any counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed,"" he said. A spokesman for Manafort, Jason Maloni, said Manafort ""has consistently cooperated with law enforcement and other serious inquiries and did so on this occasion as well."" Gates' attorney, Kevin Downing, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. In the indictment, the government alleges that Manafort laundered more than $18 million through foreign bank accounts and failed to register as a foreign agent for his work on behalf of the Party of Regions, which was led at the time by Yanukovych. It also says that Gates and Manafort conspired to launder the money through scores of U.S. and foreign corporations, partnerships and shell companies, and that they lied to federal agents about their activities. They are also accused of failing to report their foreign income on their federal tax returns.",0

(Photo: David Kadlubowski/azcentral sports)The Arizona men's basketball team got off to a slow start in the Pac-12 tournament, but the Wildcats were able to get back on track with a big win over the Cougars on Thursday night. The win was Arizona's first over a top-10 team in conference play since the 2013-14 season, and it was also the first time in program history that the team had won a game against a ranked team. It was a huge win for a team that has struggled to find its identity in recent years, especially after the departure of head coach Sean Miller and the hiring of former Arizona State coach Tad Boyle as the program's new head man. Boyle has done a good job of getting the most out of the talent on the roster, which is why Arizona has been so successful this season. However, it's not just the players that have benefited from Boyle's system. Arizona is also getting a lot of help from the coaching staff, as Boyle is the only coach in school history to win at least 20 games in each of his first two seasons at the helm. He's also one of only two coaches in college basketball history who has won 20 or more games three times in his career, the other being Mike Krzyzewski at Duke in 2008-09 and 2011-2012. In addition to Boyle, Arizona also has a number of other coaches on staff who have been successful in their own right, including assistant coach Mark Turgeon, who was named to the 2016-17 All-Big 12 First Team after leading the Sun Devils to an 11-2 record and a second-place finish in Big 12 play.",0

The suspect allegedly told the victim that he was a police officer and that she could not buy the car because she did not have a valid driver's license.

The report will also include a timeline for achieving the goal, the statement said, adding that the plan will be ""based on the best available science, technology, and engineering information"".

NASA has been working on a Mars mission for more than a decade, but it has not yet selected a launch vehicle or crew for the mission, which is expected to take place in the 2030s or early 2040s. In a statement, NASA said it was ""pleased"" with Trump's order. ""We look forward to working with the administration and Congress to ensure that we have the resources we need to reach Mars as quickly and safely as possible,"" said agency spokeswoman Kirstin Grantham.

7781,Pumpkin spice air freshener blamed for emergency response at school in Baltimore," Copyright by WJZ - All rights reserved VideoALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A New York City school district says a pumpkin spice-flavored aerosol can is to blame for a deadly asthma attack in a student at a school on the city's West Side. The student, who has not been identified, was rushed to a hospital with severe breathing problems after inhaling the can, which was found in the student's backpack, according to the district's chief medical officer, Dr. Michael Osterholm. He says the inhaler was used by a teacher at the school, but the teacher has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation. Ostersholm says it's the first time he's heard of a case like this. ""This is a very rare event,"" he said. In a statement, Mayor Bill de Blasio called the incident a ""terrible tragedy"" and said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the death of the 17-year-old student. De Blasio says he has asked the state Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to conduct an independent investigation into the cause of death.

7401,Crosby gets 999th career point as Penguins beat Canucks," 4-3 in OTBy JON KRAWCZYNSKI-USA TODAY Sports
PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Sidney Crosby scored the game-winning goal in overtime to lift the Pittsburgh Penguins to a fourth straight victory over the Vancouver Canucks, who fell to 0-4-1 in their past five games.
 the Penguins won for the fifth time in six meetings with the Canucks (0-5-0), who have lost four of five. The Penguins have won four straight at home against Vancouver, which has lost five of its past six games at Consol Energy Center, including a 3-2 shootout loss to the New York Rangers on Saturday night. ""It's been a long time since we've won here, so it's nice to get a win,"" said Crosby, the NHL's all-time leader in goals and points with 1,812, and the only player in NHL history to score at least 100 goals in each of his first five seasons. Crosby also had a goal and an assist in the overtime win over Vancouver on Nov. 21, 2010. He had two assists in a 4 1/2-game winning streak from Jan. 1 to Feb. 6, 2011. Sidney's goal was his second in regulation this season, tying him with Wayne Gretzky for second on the franchise's career list behind Gordie Howe. It was also the first overtime goal of Crosby's NHL career, surpassing his previous career high of two goals, set against the Los Angeles Kings on Dec. 29, 2007. In the third period, he scored on a one-timer from the right circle to give Pittsburgh a 2-goal lead, but Vancouver answered with a power-play goal by Henrik Sedin to tie it at 2. After a Vancouver power play goal, Ryan Kesler tied it again with an empty-net goal at 5:38 of the second period. But it was too little, too late, as the puck bounced off the post and into the empty net to seal the victory for Pittsburgh, its third straight win in this series and first in Vancouver since a 7-6 overtime victory in Game 6 of last season's Stanley Cup Final. Vancouver had won three straight games against Pittsburgh before that, with both wins coming on home ice. Goalie Roberto Luongo made 31 saves for his third shutout of this postseason, giving him a.923 save percentage in his past four starts. Ryan Miller stopped 29 shots in goal for Vancouver. Defenseman Kevin Bieksa made his NHL debut, playing in place of injured defenseman Dan Hamhuis (lower-body injury). The Canucks were without defenseman Alex Edler (upper body) and forward Chris Tanev (concussion), both of whom were injured in Saturday's game. Canucks coach Willie Desjardins said he didn't want to put too much pressure on his young defensemen to step up and make a big impact, especially since the team is still trying to figure out what to do with its top two centers, Alex Burrows and Jannik Hansen, both out with injuries. They're expected to be out for a couple of weeks, possibly longer, after both suffered concussions in Friday's loss at New Jersey. With the loss, Vancouver dropped to 1-10-7 in games decided by one goal or less, while Pittsburgh has won eight of those games by a total of six goals or more. Both teams are coming off back-to-back road losses. Pittsburgh was outshot 31-18 and out-chanced its opponents by an average of 5.3 to 4.2. That included a 5-for-15 performance from its power plays, where the Pens were outscored 11-8. On the other end, Canucks goalie Eddie Lack was pulled after giving up three goals on 13 shots. Lack has allowed four goals over his last three starts, dating back to his rookie season in 2006-07, when he was a first-round draft pick by the Columbus Blue Jackets.",0

In addition, the Venezuelan government has been unable to provide basic food and medicine to its citizens for the past two years. As a result, Venezuelans have been forced to resort to eating what they can find in garbage cans, trash bins, or on the streets. This is not an isolated incident, but rather a symptom of a much larger problem. Venezuela is suffering from a severe food crisis that is affecting the health and well-being of its people.

702,"Lawsuit Argues Army Should Factor PTSD In Discharge Decisions "" CBS New York"," reports that a lawsuit has been filed against the U.S. Army, arguing that it should factor PTSD in the discharge decisions of soldiers who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. The suit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) on behalf of a soldier who was discharged from the Army because of PTSD. ""The Army has a duty to protect its soldiers from harm, but it has failed to do so in this case,"" said ACLU Staff Attorney Jameel Jaffer, who is representing the soldier. According to the suit, the plaintiff was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) when he was deployed to Iraq in 2007. He was then deployed again to Afghanistan in 2009 and 2010, where he served as an infantryman with the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division. During his second deployment, he suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI) that left him unable to perform his job duties. After returning from his third deployment in 2012, his commanding officer decided to discharge him because he did not meet the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis. However, according to his lawsuit, that decision was based on the fact that he had not received any treatment for his TBI, which was not diagnosed until after he left the military.""We are pleased to see that the Department of Defense is taking steps to ensure that service members who suffer from PTSD receive the care and treatment they need to get back on their feet and return to their families and communities,"" CCR Executive Director Anthony D. Romero said in a statement.",0

, the Saudi crown prince, is in the US for a week-long visit that will see him meet US President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, at the White House. He will also visit New York, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia before returning to Saudi Arabia, where he is expected to meet with King Salman and other senior officials. The trip is the first by a Saudi head of state since the death of King Abdullah in January, and comes at a sensitive time for the kingdom, which has been rocked by the Arab Spring uprisings that have spread across the Middle East and North Africa in recent years. Salman, who is also defence minister, will be accompanied on the trip by his deputy, Mohammed bin Nayef, as well as a number of senior Saudi officials, including Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, deputy minister of defence; Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, governor of Riyadh province; and Prince Khalid bin Ayyaf Al-Muqrin, Saudi ambassador to the U.S.The visit is being seen as an attempt by Salman to project an image of a modern Saudi state that is more open and tolerant than the one he inherited from his father, King Fahd, in 2005, when he took over the throne from Abdullah. But Salman's visit comes amid a series of high-profile arrests and detentions of Saudi dissidents and human rights activists, many of whom have been accused of links with the Muslim Brotherhood, an ultraconservative Sunni group that the Saudis consider a terrorist organisation.Saudi Arabia has also been criticised for its treatment of women, with women not allowed to drive and forced to wear the abaya, a full-body cloak that covers the entire body except the eyes and hands. Saudi women are also banned from travelling abroad without the permission of their male guardians.In his first public appearance since his return, Salman told reporters in Riyadh on Sunday that he was looking forward to meeting Trump, whom he described as",0

""The decision to resign was made after the meeting between the President and Prime Minister,"" the statement said. ""The council will continue to work in accordance with its mandate, which is to represent the interests of all Libyan citizens."" The statement did not specify what the council's mandate was. It was not immediately clear if the resignations were related to the ongoing conflict in Libya or to a dispute over the election of a new president. A spokesman for the Council of Ministers, Mustafa Abdel Jalil, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that he had no information about the matter. He said he was unaware of any resignation or resignation letter being sent to President Sisi, who has been in power since the ouster of longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. In an interview with Al Arabiya TV on Sunday, President Abdel-Jalil said, ""I don't know what is going on in Egypt, but I am sure that there is a lot of tension between Egypt and Libya."" He also said that Libya was a ""strategic partner"" of Egypt. On Monday, the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to authorize the use of force against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, in Syria and Iraq if it continues to threaten international peace and security. But the resolution also called on all parties to refrain from any actions that would ""undermine the territorial integrity or political independence of either Iraq or Syria,"" and to ""ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.""",0

(Yuri Kadobnov/Pool Pho","ebus/AP)The U.S. State Department said Wednesday that it is ""deeply concerned"" by reports that Venezuela's government is planning a military takeover of the country's oil industry, and called on the Maduro government to ""immediately cease all actions that could undermine the Venezuelan people's right to self-determination, including the seizure of state-owned oil companies and the imposition of martial law."" The statement was issued in response to a report by the Associated Press, which said that the government of President Nicolás Maduro is preparing a plan to seize control of oil production and export facilities in the oil-rich country.

The Venezuelan government did not immediately respond to the AP's request for comment. Venezuela is the world's No. 2 crude oil exporter, behind Saudi Arabia. It is also the second-largest oil producer in South America, after Brazil. Maduro has been in power since 2013, when his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, died of cancer.

4684,Study of footballers' brains highlights dementia concerns," Read moreThe study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Neurology, is the first of its kind to look at the long-term effects of repeated blows to the head. It is also the largest to date, involving more than 1,000 former football players.
It found that the brains of those who had suffered repeated concussions were more likely to show signs of dementia than those of players who did not suffer repeated head injuries. The researchers also found evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), the degenerative brain disease that has been linked to repeated brain trauma in football and other contact sports, including boxing, wrestling and ice hockey. CTE can only be diagnosed posthumously, but it is thought to be caused by repetitive head trauma and can lead to memory loss, depression, aggression, suicidal thoughts and even Parkinson's-like symptoms in people with the disease, which can take decades to develop and is usually diagnosed after a person has already suffered a number of head traumas, such as being hit by a car or falling from a great height, or being struck by another player's helmet during a football game or a rugby match, for example. In some cases, it can also be triggered by other types of traumatic brain injury, like a head injury sustained in a motor vehicle accident or an industrial accident, the researchers said. ""Our findings suggest that repeated subconcussive head impacts may increase the risk of neurodegenerative disease in later life,"" said the study's lead author, Dr Robert Cantu, a professor of neurology at Boston University School of Medicine in Boston, Massachusetts, and a neurosurgeon at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). ""It is important to note, however, that our findings do not prove a cause-and-effect relationship and further research is needed to better understand the relationship between head impact exposure and neuropathology.""

 the ABC's 7.30 program has learned the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is being held at the Manus Island centre because his parents have failed to apply for refugee status in Australia. The boy's father, a Sri Lankan national, has applied for a visa to come to Australia, but the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) has refused to process his application because he is not an Australian citizen. His mother, an Iranian national who lives in the United Arab Emirates, also has not applied to be a citizen of the country she has lived in for the past five years, and is therefore not eligible to sponsor her son's asylum application. In a letter to the parents, the department said it would not process the father's visa application until the mother's application had been processed. ""The Department is unable to provide you with any further information at this time,"" the letter said. It said the family would be provided with an update on the status of their application by the end of this month. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said he was ""disappointed"" with the decision, which he described as ""unfortunate"". ""I think it's a very unfortunate decision,"" he told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday. He said his department was working to resolve the situation.

3757,AP sources: Trump administration expected to renew temporary protected status for Syrians but not take new applicants,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's administration is expected Wednesday to announce that it will renew a temporary protection from deportation for as many as 590,000 people who entered the U.S. illegally as children, but will not accept new applications for the program, according to two people familiar with the matter. The move would be the latest in a series of executive actions Trump has taken to crack down on illegal immigration, including a ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries and a plan to build a wall along the border with Mexico. It would also mark the first time in more than a decade that the administration has not taken new immigrants into the country under the so-called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. Trump announced in September that he was ending the Obama-era program that allowed the young immigrants to stay in the United States and work without fear of deportation. But he has yet to make a final decision on the fate of the roughly 800,00 people currently protected by DACA. A senior administration official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity that Trump will announce the renewal of DACA at the White House on Wednesday. ""We're not going to take any more applications,"" the official said, adding that DACA recipients would not be able to apply for work permits or other forms of legal status until the end of March. DACA is one of several immigration programs that have been in effect since 2012, when President Barack Obama signed an executive order to protect immigrants brought to the US illegally when they were children. Obama's DACA program is set to expire on March 5, 2018, unless Congress acts to extend it for an additional six months. Congress has failed to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill since 2013, and Trump, who campaigned on a promise to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, has vowed to do just that. He has also threatened to cut off federal funding to sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, a move that would make it more difficult for local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws.",0

He called the move a ""disgrace"" and said it would have ""a devastating impact"" on the local economies of those two states.In a letter to the White House on Tuesday, Utah's Republican senator, Orrin Hatch, wrote that the president's move would ""have a devastating effect on our state's economy and our ability to attract and retain the best and brightest young people to work and live here"".Hatch, who chairs the Senate committee that oversees the Interior Department, added that he had ""grave concerns"" over the decision and called on Trump to reconsider it.The president has not yet made a final decision on whether the monuments will remain in place or be rescinded, according to a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

The researchers say that the technique could one day be used to treat a wide range of diseases, including blindness, muscular dystrophy, and heart disease. ""This is the first time that we've been able to use this technology to fix a disease-causing mutation,"" says UCSF geneticist Jennifer Doudna, the senior author of the study and a professor of molecular and cell biology and of genetics. She is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and an investigator with the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). ""It's a very exciting time to be working in this field,"" she says, ""because there are so many diseases that could potentially be treated with this kind of technology.""

2876,China's military potential nears European level,"China has been building up its military capabilities in recent years, and it is now on the cusp of becoming a full-fledged military power, according to a new report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).
The report, titled China's Military Potential Near European Level, was released on Tuesday. It is based on a survey of the country's armed forces conducted in 2013 and 2014, as well as on interviews with military experts and experts from the United States, Russia, Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Cyprus, Serbia, Montenegro, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The report is the first of its kind to assess the Chinese military's potential in Europe and is likely to be a major source of information for policymakers in the region. the report states that China is on track to become the world's second-largest military spender after the U.S. by 2020, with a projected military budget of more than $200 billion. China has already surpassed Russia in terms of military spending, which is expected to rise to $150 billion in 2020 from $100 billion this year. In addition, China plans to spend more on defense than any other country by 2030, surpassing Germany and Japan in that year's rankings. According to the study, Chinese defense spending is projected to reach $1.5 trillion by 2035, a figure that would be nearly double the current level of $600 billion, or about one-third of total global military expenditures.The study also notes that the number of Chinese troops stationed in European countries has increased significantly over the past decade, from just over 1,000 in 2005 to nearly 2,500 in 2014.

Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Jury convicts man of kidnapping, rape, murder in Etz case, nearly 40 yrs. after boy's disappearance / 'I'm not a monster,' says man sentenced to life in prison for kidnapping and raping a 12-year-old boy, authorities say. / The jury deliberated for more than two hours before finding him guilty of first-degree murder and kidnapping in the death of Etzel Perkowski, who disappeared in 1975. He was convicted of raping and murdering the boy. The verdict was read in a courtroom packed with family members and friends of both the victim and the defendant. ""I don't know what I'm going to do,"" the man said as he was led from the courtroom, his hands cuffed behind his back and his face covered by a blue jail jumpsuit. After the verdicts were read, the jury foreman said, ""This is the worst day of my life. I've never seen anything like this in my entire life."" The man, whose name has not been released because of his age, will be eligible for parole in about 20 years, according to the judge's order. His lawyer said he plans to appeal the conviction and sentence, which was handed down after a two-week trial in which the prosecution and defense rested their cases. Prosecutors said they believed they had enough evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, but the defense argued that the evidence was circumstantial and that there was no physical evidence linking the two men. They also said the state's case was weak because it relied heavily on the testimony of a man who claimed to have been present at the crime scene but who was never questioned by police or prosecutors. In addition, they said there were no eyewitnesses, no DNA evidence and no witnesses who had seen the pair together before or after the alleged crime. But defense attorneys said that was not enough to convict them of murder, and they pointed to other evidence, such as the fact that both men admitted to having sex with the child, as well as testimony from other witnesses, to argue that they were not responsible for the girl's death. Defense attorneys also pointed out that a forensic pathologist who examined the body concluded that it had been killed by blunt force trauma, not strangulation or a sexual assault. And they noted that police and prosecutors had failed to turn over key evidence that could have helped them prove their clients' innocence, including a videotape that allegedly showed the men having sexual intercourse with a young girl, a key piece of evidence used by prosecutors in their case against the defendants. During the trial, jurors were shown a video that purported to be a sex tape between the accused and a girl who said she was 12 years old when she met the boys. It was shown to jurors during closing arguments and during the sentencing phase, where they heard from a number of witnesses. One of those witnesses was a woman who identified herself as a former classmate of Perko's. She told jurors that she had known him for about a year when he came to her high school and asked her out on a date. When she said no, he allegedly told her he had a crush on her and invited her over to his house to watch a movie. On the way there, she says he took her to a secluded area and raped her. Later that night, when they got home, her mother found her daughter dead in her bed. Her body was covered in bruises and her throat was slit. Police later found a bloody knife near her body. A few days after her death, police found Perkovitz's car near the scene of her murder. There were bloodstains on his pants and shirt, along with semen and semen-stained underwear. DNA tests later linked him to both murders. Perkin's mother testified that her son had never been violent toward her or her family and had no history of mental illness or substance abuse. At the time of their disappearance, Perkoski was living with his mother and stepfather, both of whom were in jail awaiting trial on charges of child abuse and child endangerment. Both men were convicted and are serving lengthy prison sentences for their crimes.",0

7685,Oroville residents return home after evacuation orders for dam spillway erosion lifted,"The Oroville Dam is seen on Wednesday, Sept. 1, 2017, after the evacuation order was lifted. (Photo: Paul Chinn, The Sacramento Bee, via AP) Story Highlights The dam is the tallest in the United States and one of the largest in California, with a capacity of 770,000 cubic feet of water per second. It was built in 1968 and was designed to withstand a 7.0-magnitude earthquake and a 100-year flood. The reservoir holds more than 1.5 million acre-feet of rainwater.
More than 2,500 people have been evacuated from the area, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is working with local officials to assess the damage to the dam and to determine the best course of action to restore power and water to affected areas. Officials are also assessing the impact on the nearby Feather River, a tributary that flows into the reservoir and is a major source of drinking water for many communities in Northern California's Central Valley. More than 3,600 homes and businesses are without power, the California Department of Water Resources said.
.@CA_DWR: Damage assessment underway at #OROVILLE Dam. pic.twitter.com/qjz8q6QjZv — CA DWR (@CADwr) September 1st, 2016
 the Oroville Dam, which has been the subject of intense scrutiny in recent weeks, is expected to remain closed for at least the next few days, according to a statement from California Gov. Jerry Brown, who declared a state of emergency for the region on Tuesday.The dam's emergency status will remain in effect until further notice, Brown said, adding that the state will continue to work with the federal government to ensure the safety of people and property.Brown said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the loss of life, but added that ""we must do everything we can to protect the people of our state and protect our environment.""He said the emergency declaration will allow state agencies to coordinate with federal agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to ""ensure that we have the resources we need to respond to and recover from this disaster.""The governor also said that he had spoken with President-elect Donald Trump about the situation and that they had discussed the need for federal assistance to help with recovery efforts.In addition to evacuating residents, officials have also ordered the closure of all roads and trails in and around the affected area.Officials said they expect to have power restored to most of those who were forced to leave their homes Tuesday night, though some areas may not be fully restored for several days.""We're going to be working very closely with our federal partners to make sure we get the power back on as quickly as possible,"" said Brown. ""We want to get people back to where they were before this happened. We want them to feel safe and secure.""Officials have not yet determined how much water will be needed to repair the damaged dam, or how long it will take to do so. But they have estimated that it could take up to two years to fully repair it.A spokesman for California WaterFix, an environmental group that has worked with state officials on emergency response efforts, said it was too early to say how many people would be able to return to their flooded homes.But he said there was a good chance that many of them would have to move to higher ground.""It's not a matter of if, it's a question of when,"" he told The Associated Press by phone from San Diego, where the group is helping with relief efforts.""There are a lot of families that have lost everything. They're just trying to figure out how to rebuild their lives.""In the meantime, residents are being urged to stay off the roads, stay inside and stay away from windows, doors and windowsills, as well as from trees and power lines that may have fallen on them.They also are advised to avoid drinking and cooking water from faucets and other sources that could have come into contact with water that is not safe to drink or cook with.People who are unable to go home because of flooding should call their local emergency number, such as 1-800-521-3131, for information on how they can get help.Residents who live in areas that are not under a mandatory evacuation are encouraged to check with their county emergency management agency to see if they are eligible for assistance.For more information, go to www.cdw.ca.gov/oroville.Read or Share this story: http://vtd-tar.co/2bXn7zS",0

Trump's approval rating is at an all-time low of 36% the market is down nearly 2% this week, its biggest weekly drop in nearly two years. Trump is now the least popular president in U.S. history, according to a Gallup poll released Thursday.
, Trump's first 100 days in office have been marked by a series of executive orders, legislative setbacks and a string of scandals that have cast doubt on his ability to govern effectively. He has also been dogged by questions about whether his campaign colluded with Russia during last year's election, and whether he obstructed justice when he fired former FBI Director James Comey in May.Trump has said he plans to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington, D.C., and has vowed to overhaul the nation's tax code. But he has struggled to get his agenda through Congress, with Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress and the White House.On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced that the Senate would not vote on a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, before the end of the year.The Senate is expected to take up a repeal-and-replace bill later this month, though it is unclear if it will be able to pass the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a Democratic filibuster.Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, told reporters on Wednesday that he was ""not optimistic"" about passing a health-care bill this year.""I don't think it's going to happen,"" he said. ""I'm not optimistic that we can get to 60 votes.""Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said on Tuesday that Republicans would have to come up with a plan to replace Obamacare before they could move on to tax reform and other legislative priorities.""We're not there yet,"" Schumer said in an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""We've got a lot of work to do. We have a long way to go before we get there.""Trump is also facing criticism for his response to the violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend, in which a woman was killed when a driver plowed his car into a crowd of counterprotesters.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Thursday that Trump ""condemns all forms of violence, bigotry and hatred in all of its forms.""But she also said the president ""does not believe that there is a moral equivalency between white supremacists and people protesting the removal of a confederate statue from a city park.""Sanders said Trump had spoken with the widow of Heather Heyer, who died after being hit by the car driven by James Alex Fields Jr., a 20-year-old Ohio man who was later charged with second-degree murder.Sanders did not say whether Trump was aware of Fields' history of anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi sympathies.In a tweet Thursday morning, Sanders wrote: ""The president condemns all acts of domestic terrorism, white supremacy and hate in any form.""She added, ""He also condemns the KKK, Neo-Nazis, White Supremacists, & other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.""On Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to South Korea, said that ""there is no place in our society for violence of any kind.""Pence said there were ""many sides to every story"" and that it was up to Americans to decide what side they wanted to be on.""There's no doubt in my mind that America is better off when people of good will come together and stand up for the values that make us who we are as a nation,"" Pence said, adding that Americans should not be afraid to disagree with each other.",0

The charges stem from an incident that took place on September 13, 2017, at a home on the 100 block of North Main Street in Hernandoo County.According to the arrest report, the victim, who is not being identified by name because he is a juvenile, was asleep in his bed when he was awakened by the sound of a gunshot. When he opened his eyes, he saw a man standing over him with a gun pointed at his head.The victim told police that the man told him to get up and leave the house, but he refused to do so. He said he then heard a second gunshot, which he believed to be the same one that woke him up.When he went to check on his girlfriend, she was not there, so he returned to his room and called 911.Police arrived on scene and found the woman dead in her bed. She had been shot multiple times and her body was covered in blood. Her boyfriend was also shot and was taken to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.Detectives believe the two men knew each other and that they were in a relationship.

""It's not just a toy, it's a tool that will change the way we live, work and play. It's the most exciting thing I've seen in a long time.""
3D printing has been around since the 1980s, but it wasn't until the early 2000s that it really took off. Companies like Stratasys, MakerBot and others began printing objects out of plastic, metal and other materials. The technology is now used in everything from cars to medical devices to furniture. In the last few years, however, a number of startups have emerged that are using the technology to make a wide range of products, from jewelry to jewelry-making machines to cars that can be customized to fit a customer's specific needs. These companies have been able to take advantage of the printing process's ability to create objects with a variety of shapes and sizes, as well as the fact that the materials used to print them are relatively inexpensive..@shapeways #3dprinting pic.twitter.com/qjzvj9z8Zv — Shapeway (@Shapeway) April 20, 2015

, which was founded in 2013, is one of those startups. Founded by a group of Stanford University students and funded by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, the company is focused on creating a new class of consumer products that don't require a lot of time or money to produce. Instead, they're made using a process known as additive manufacturing, in which a small amount of material is added to an existing object, such as a plastic bottle or a piece of metal. This material can then be printed out in different colors, shapes, sizes and materials, allowing for the creation of many different products at once.The company's most recent product is a $1,000 car-shaped jewelry machine called the ""ShoppeCar,"" which is designed to allow customers to customize the look and feel of their car with the help of a smartphone app. Customers can download the app and select a color, shape and size of car they'd like to have customized. Once the car is customized, customers can order it online and have it delivered to their home or office, or they can pick it up at a local store.In addition to making jewelry and cars, other companies are also working on ways to use the new technology. For example, 3DPrinting.org, a website that allows users to download and print their own objects, was launched last year and has more than 1,500 members, according to the site's founder, who declined to give his name for fear of reprisals from companies that might use his site to sell their products.",0

The tax filing, which was first reported by the Times, shows that the company paid an effective federal tax rate of just 0.005 percent on its $1.8 billion in revenue in the second quarter of the year. That's less than one-tenth of 1 percent, and far below the rates paid by companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and others that have been under scrutiny in recent months for paying little or no tax to the U.S. government. In a statement, the Trump Organization said it was ""pleased"" with how the tax code was being applied. ""We are pleased to report that we have paid all applicable federal, state and local taxes, as required by law,"" the statement said, adding that it ""will continue to work with Congress and the IRS to ensure that all of our business operations are conducted in a manner that is consistent with our responsibility to pay all federal taxes that are due."" The report comes as the White House is facing increasing pressure to release more information about the president's tax returns. Trump has repeatedly said that he will not release his returns until an IRS audit is complete, but he has not provided any evidence to back up that claim.",0

6211,THE HEART AND SOUL OF COUNTRY | “First Lady of Country Soul” Petrella grooves in VC,"'s ""The Heart And Soul Of Country""""The heart and soul of country"" is a phrase that has been used to describe the music and lyrics of many of the country music artists that have graced the airwaves over the past few decades. The phrase is often used as a compliment, but it's also a bit of a misnomer. Country music is not a genre. It's a style of music, and the genre is defined by the songs that are played on the radio. There is no such thing as ""country music."" There are many genres, including rock, pop, R&B, hip-hop, blues, jazz, country, etc. But there is one thing that all of these genres have in common: they are all rooted in the American South. In fact, there are so many different types of Southern music that it would be impossible to list them all here. So, instead, we'll focus on just a few of them. Let's take a look at some of our favorite country artists and see what they have to say about the South and its people.
1. J.J. Cale – ""I'm From The South, I'm Proud To Be An American, And I Don't Want To Go Back To Where I Came From"" (from the album ""South Of The Border"" by The Black Crowes) ”Cale is from the small town of Greenville, South Carolina, where he grew up in a family of farmers and ranchers. He was raised by his grandmother, who taught him how to read and write. After graduating from high school, he went on to attend the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, graduating with a degree in political science and a minor in history. When he was in his mid-twenties, his family moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music. They settled in Nashville's Music Row, which is now known as the ""Music City"" and is home to a number of well-known artists, such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Elvis Presley, Stevie Wonder, John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Paul McCartney, Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen and many more. While he has since relocated to Los Angeles, California, the roots of his music are still very much with his home state. His latest album, ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow,"" was released in 2013 and features the hit single ""Don't Stop Believin',"" which was written and produced by Cales' wife, singer-songwriter Tanya Tagaq. She is also the lead singer and songwriter for the rock band The Dixie Chicks. †2. Kenny Chesney – ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction (From) The Bottom Of My Heart (And The Heart Of) A Country Boy"" from his album The Best Of Kenny & The Chesneys (2007)
... ‡3. John Fogerty – ""'Til Death Do Us Part (I'll Be There For You)"" from The Fogers' album I'll be There for You (2006).‡4. Hank Williams Jr. – ""…And I Love Her Like A Brother (But She's Not My Brother) "" from Hank's album You're Gonna Miss Me When I Die (2008)†5. Johnny Cash – The Man Who Loved Me (1965) from Cash's 1965 album Cash, Cash & More Cash (1966)6. Willie Nelson – Willie's Blues (1969)from Nelson's 1969 album Willie, Willie and More Willie (1970)7. Dolly Parton – I Won't Back Down (1971)8. Sam Cooke – Sam's Town (1973)9. Bob Marley – Born In The U.S.A. (1975)10. Elvis Costello – Graceland (1977)11. George Strait – All I Need Is Love (1979)12.

3268,"Aho, Hurricanes beat Senators 2-1"," in OTThe Hurricanes and Senators played to a scoreless draw in the first period of their game Saturday night at the Canadian Tire Centre in Ottawa. The game was tied at 1 after two periods, but the Senators scored twice in a span of three minutes to tie the game at one. Senators defenseman Mark Borowiecki scored his first goal of the season on a shot from the right circle, and the Hurricanes scored their second goal, a power-play goal by Eric Staal, to take a 1-0 lead into the second intermission. Hurricanes goalie Cam Ward stopped all three shots he faced to earn his second shutout in as many games. ""It was a good game for us,"" Hurricanes coach Bill Peters said of his team's effort in front of a sold-out crowd of 18,715. Staals, who had a goal and two assists, was named the NHL's first star of night. He also won the Selke Trophy, given to the league's top defensive forward, as voted on by the Professional Hockey Writers' Association, for his performance in Saturday's game. Carolina has won three straight games, including a 5-2 victory over the New York Rangers on Saturday.
""It's a great feeling to win a game like that, especially when you're playing against a team like the Rangers,"" said Hurricanes defenseman Justin Faulk, whose goal was his third in his last four games (2-3-5). ""They're a tough team to play against. They've got a lot of skill and they're really good on the power play. We just have to be ready for them."" The Hurricanes have won five of six games since the All-Star break, with their last loss coming on Jan. 28 at New Jersey. Florida, which has lost four of five, is coming off a 4-4 overtime loss at Ottawa on Friday. Forward Jaromir Jagr scored two goals and had an assist in that game, while Carolina's Jarome Iginla was held off the scoresheet with an empty-net goal in overtime. Panthers coach Gerard Gallant said he was pleased with the way the team responded after the loss to Ottawa, despite the fact that he didn't have his top line of Jussi Jokinen, Aleksander Barkov and Jonathan Huberdeau available due to an illness. ""(Jagr) is a big part of our team and we're going to need him to score some goals,"" Gall",0

4201,Holocaust memorial urges vigilance after US protests,"The US Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) has urged Americans to be on the lookout for signs of anti-Semitism in the wake of the recent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a public park.
In a statement on its website, the museum said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the violence that erupted on Saturday, when a car plowed into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring more than a dozen others. The car's driver, James Alex Fields Jr., has been charged with second-degree murder and other counts, and is being held in a local jail without bail. He is scheduled to appear in court on Monday, according to the Associated Press. ""We are deeply saddened by today's events,"" the statement said, adding that ""we stand in solidarity with the people of Charlottesville and condemn all forms of racism, white supremacy and neo-Nazism in all their forms and manifestations."" The statement also said that the US HMM ""will continue to monitor the situation closely and will provide updates as they become available."" In a separate statement, US President Donald Trump said he condemned ""in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides."" ""Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, Neo-Nazis, White Supremacists, Anti-Semites and others who are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,"" he said. Trump's comments came after he was criticized for failing to explicitly condemn the white supremacist groups that organized the rally, which was attended by white nationalists, Ku Klux Klan members and members of other far-right groups. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Tuesday that Trump had ""full confidence"" in his chief of staff, John Kelly, who was sworn in as the new secretary of homeland security on Friday. Sanders said the president had spoken to both Kelly and Vice President Mike Pence about the events in Virginia. She added: ""The president has made it very clear that there is no moral equivalency between white supremacists and people who come together to express a different point of view."" Trump has faced criticism for not explicitly condemning the groups involved in Saturday's violence. In an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on ""Good Morning America"" on Sunday, Trump was asked whether he had condemned the ""alt-left,"" a term he has used to refer to groups such as Antifa, or ""anti-fascists,"" who have been at the forefront of protests against a planned white-supremacist ""Unite the Right"" rally on Aug. 12. When asked if he did, he replied, ""I did not say that. I didn't say I was going to condemn groups, I said there's blame on both sides. You had a group on one side that came charging in without a permit and they were very, very violent. They were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very important statue and the renaming of an park."" He added that he ""didn't see anything wrong with that other than you have to have some kind of punishment"" for the protesters. On Tuesday, however, in response to a question from CNN's Jake Tapper about whether Trump should have specifically condemned groups like the Klan and Nazis, Sanders responded that she was not ""going to get into hypotheticals"" about what Trump would have said had he been given the chance to do so.",0

4189,3 suspects handed terror charges in thwarted French attack,"French police have arrested four people in connection with the thwarted terror attack in Paris that left at least 129 people dead and more than 350 injured.
The arrests were made in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis and the southern city of Toulouse, the French interior ministry said in a statement late on Sunday. The four were being held on suspicion of ""participating in an armed terrorist group"", the statement said. It did not give further details on the nature of the group or the alleged involvement of any of those arrested. France's interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said on Twitter that the four had been taken into custody and would be charged with terrorism-related offences. He said the suspects were not known to the authorities and that they had not been involved in any previous terror attacks. ""This is the first time that we have had such a large-scale operation in France,"" he said, adding that it was a ""very, very serious"" operation. A French police officer stands guard at the scene of a hostage situation at a kosher supermarket in Saint Denis, near Paris, France, November 13, 2015. REUTERS/Jacky Naegelen/File Photo The arrests came as French President Francois Hollande vowed to hunt down those responsible for the attack, which he described as ""an act of war"". ""We will find them, we will bring them to justice,"" Hollande said during a visit to a military base in northern France where troops are training to fight Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said he was ""shocked and saddened"" by the attacks, but added: ""France will not be intimidated by terrorism."" He added that France would continue its fight against terrorism ""with all the means at our disposal, including the use of military force"". The Paris prosecutor's office said it had opened a terrorism investigation into the shooting and hostage-taking that took place inside the kosher grocery store in eastern Paris on Friday night. Police had earlier said they were looking for three men who were believed to have carried out the assault. One of them was wearing a ski mask and was armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, a handgun and a box cutter, according to French media reports. Two other men were wearing balaclavas and had their faces covered, French television station BFMTV reported, citing a source close to Paris police. They were said to be wearing fake suicide vests and were holding hostages inside a store that was being used as a hideout by a group of people who had come to carry out an attack on a Jewish community centre, police sources told Reuters. At least one person was killed and another was seriously injured when a gunman stormed the store and opened fire with an AK-47 assault weapon, witnesses told the AFP news agency. Another man was shot dead by police as he tried to flee the building, it added. In a separate incident, two people were arrested in Marseille after a man drove a car at high speed into a crowd of anti-racism protesters, killing one and injuring several others, local media reported. Reuters contributed to this report.",0
742,Report: Mike Francesa Planning Return To Sports Radio WFAN,"By Josh Maurer, BDN Staff • May 19, 2016 6:00 am
, BDn file photo The Boston Red Sox are planning to return to the radio airwaves of the New York-based sports talk radio station WBZ-AM in the near future, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. ""We're going to do it,"" said the person, who asked not to be identified because the plan is still being worked out. It's unclear when the return will take place, but it could be as soon as next week, the same person said. In a statement, a spokesman for the station said, ""WBZ is pleased to have the opportunity to work with Mike and his team once again. We look forward to working with him to continue to bring the best in sports radio to our listeners."" The station, which is owned by WGBH-FM in Boston, declined to comment further. A person with direct knowledge of Mike's plans said he has been in discussions with a number of potential new employers, including the Boston Celtics and New England Patriots, and is expected to announce his decision soon. He is scheduled to appear on WEEI's ""The Dennis & Callahan Show"" on Monday, May 21, at 7:30 p.m. (all times Eastern).",0

A day after a deadly school bus crash in New Jersey, the state's top law enforcement official said the driver of the vehicle that struck and killed a 12-year-old girl was not criminally responsible for the crash because he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time, according to a report from the Associated Press. The driver, identified by the AP as Johnathan Ferrell, had a blood-alcohol level of 0.15 percent, more than twice the legal limit for driving in the U.S., the report said. Ferrel was charged with two counts of vehicular homicide and one count of leaving the scene of an accident involving death or serious bodily injury. He was being held in lieu of $250,000 bail at a New Brunswick, N.J., jail, where he is scheduled to appear in court on Wednesday. A spokesman for Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, said he had no comment on the investigation. ""I'm not going to get into the details of this investigation,"" Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said in an email to NPR. But he added that the governor was ""deeply saddened by this tragic accident and the loss of a young life."" The crash occurred on a busy stretch of Route 1 in Somerset County, about 30 miles north of New York City. It was the second time in less than a week that a bus carrying students from a nearby high school had been involved in a fatal crash. On Monday, an 18-wheeler carrying a group of students collided with a tractor-trailer, killing one student and seriously injuring two others. That crash was also reported to have been caused by alcohol, but no charges were filed in that case. In the latest crash, police said, two students were killed and two were seriously injured when the bus veered off the road and crashed into a parked car at about 4:30 p.m. on Monday. Police said Ferrerell was driving the car, which was carrying about 20 students, when he lost control of his vehicle and struck the girl, who was sitting in her car seat. She was taken to the hospital where she was pronounced dead. Her name has not been released pending notification of her family. Authorities said they are still trying to determine what caused the accident, and they have not said whether alcohol was a factor. They said it was too early to say whether the death was related to alcohol or other factors, such as a medical condition, that may have played a role. State police spokesman Lt. Col. John L. Molinelli said investigators were still working to piece together the facts of what happened, adding that it would be ""premature"" to make any conclusions about the cause until they had interviewed all the people who were on that bus and had spoken with the victims and their families, as well as with witnesses and emergency responders. Loved ones of those killed in Monday's crash were being interviewed by investigators, he told reporters. His comments came hours after police released a statement saying they were treating the incident as an ""accident"" and not a criminal matter. As of Tuesday morning, authorities had not released the names of anyone who died or was injured in Tuesday's accident. Two other children, ages 12 and 14, were also injured. One of them was listed in critical condition at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan, while the other was in stable condition. Both children were students at Mount Carmel High School in West Orange, NJ. Their families were notified of their deaths on Tuesday afternoon, school officials told NPR's Michele Kelemen. School officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment from NPR on whether they planned to release the students' names at this time. According to state law, if a person is found to be in violation of any state or federal law or regulation, they can be held criminally liable for their actions, even if the violation is not the result of criminal negligence or reckless disregard for human life. However, in this case, it's not clear whether that law would apply, or whether it could be used to hold the person responsible if it turns out that he or she wasn't at fault. If a driver is convicted of driving while intoxicated, their license is suspended for a period of up to six months. And if they're found guilty of reckless endangerment — which is a misdemeanor — they face a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a $2,500 fine.",0
6133,Ashes column: Men behaving badly,", women behaving well.This is not to say that men and women behave in the same way all the time, or that there are no differences between the sexes. There are, and they are important. But there is also no reason to believe that women are more likely to behave badly than men. In fact, if anything, the opposite is true. Women tend to be more generous, more empathetic and more caring than their male counterparts. They are also more willing to take risks and take responsibility for their actions, which is why they make up a larger share of the workforce. And, as I've written about before, men are less likely than women to engage in risky behavior, such as smoking, drinking and drug use. So, while there may be some gender differences in how women and men behave, they don't seem to have much to do with one another.",0

3008,"Barry Robison on Designing ""Hacksaw's"" Ridge - Down Under - Below the Line","Hackersaw Ridge is one of my favorite films of all time. It's the story of a group of young men who are sent to a remote outpost in the Australian outback to investigate a series of mysterious disappearances. The film follows the men as they attempt to solve the mystery of the missing men, while also trying to survive in a harsh environment.
The film is based on a book by the same name, which was first published in Australia in 1975. In the book, the author, Barry Robinson, wrote that he was inspired to write the screenplay for the film after reading a story about a young man who was sent out into the bush to look for a missing friend. Robinson's story was based off of his own experiences as a soldier during the Second World War, and he wanted to create a film that was as true to life as possible. He was able to do just that with the help of some of Australia's most talented actors and directors, including Peter O'Toole, who would go on to play the lead role in The Hunt for Red October, as well as the late, great John Huston. This film was a huge success at the box office, grossing over $100 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing Australian film ever. I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to be a part of this film's production and I can honestly say that it was the most fun I've ever had in my entire life.

Palestinians puzzled by US view," of Israeli-Palestinian peace talksJERUSALEM (AP) — The U.S. State Department said Monday that it is ""deeply troubled"" by the Israeli government's plan to build 3,000 new housing units in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, saying it would undermine the prospects for a two-state solution to the decades-old conflict. The announcement came a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he would not seek a peace deal with the Palestinians, a move that was widely seen as an attempt to appease hard-liners in his right-wing Likud party. ""The United States is deeply troubled by this decision, and we urge the government of Israel to reverse it immediately,"" said spokeswoman Jen Psaki in a statement. She added that the Obama administration ""will continue to work with Israel and the international community to advance peace and security for both Israelis and Palestinians."" The new units would be built on privately owned Palestinian land, she said, adding that they would ""serve no purpose other than to further inflame tensions and undermine efforts to achieve a just, lasting and comprehensive peace between the parties."" She said the plan was ""unhelpful and counterproductive to achieving peace"" and that ""it is not in Israel's national security interest to continue with this plan."" Netanyahu has said he will not accept a Palestinian state in any of the territories captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. He has also said that any peace agreement would have to be based on the pre-1967 lines, which Israel considers its ""eternal and indivisible"" capital. Palestinians seek the creation of an independent state of their own, along the lines of what they call the ""67 lines,"" which were drawn up by Egypt, Syria and Jordan after the war. Israel captured the Gaza Strip from Jordan in 1967 and annexed it in 1981. In recent years, Israel has built hundreds of new homes on land that Palestinians claim for their future state. Some of those homes have been built in disputed areas, including the eastern part of Jerusalem known as the Old City, where Palestinians want to establish a city that would become the capital of a future independent Palestinian nation. Netanyahu's announcement on Monday came after he met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah on Sunday. During the meeting, Netanyahu told Abbas that his government was ready to resume peace negotiations, but only if the Palestinian leadership agreed to recognize Israel as a Jewish state with a capital in Jerusalem. Abbas, in turn, told Netanyahu he was not interested in such a deal, according to a senior Palestinian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to discuss the matter publicly. A senior Israeli official told The Associated Press that Netanyahu and Abbas had a ""constructive"" discussion, with Netanyahu saying he wanted Abbas to accept the status quo and to stop the construction of Jewish settlements in occupied territory. But the senior official said it was unclear whether the two leaders would meet again. Earlier Monday, Abbas said in an interview with Al-Aqsa TV that Israel had ""no right"" to expand settlements on occupied Palestinian territory and called for an immediate halt to settlement activity. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, he said: ""We have a right to live in peace with our neighbors. We don't need any more settlements. They are illegal, they are an obstacle to peace."" He added, however, that settlements were not the only issue that should be discussed in future negotiations. Palestinian officials have repeatedly said they want a final status agreement to include the right of return for Palestinian refugees to their homes and lands in what is now Israel, as well as other issues, such as borders and Jerusalem's holy sites. Israeli officials say the settlements are a major stumbling block to such an agreement. On Sunday, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon said Israel would continue building in settlements, even if it meant moving some of its troops out of areas where they have lived for decades. Yaalon told Army Radio that Israeli troops would remain in areas in which they had been stationed for ""a very long time."" ""It's not a question of moving them, it's a matter of keeping them in place,"" he told the radio station. Asked about the new settlement plan, the IDF Spokesman's Unit issued a brief statement saying, ""There is no change to our policy regarding settlement construction in Judea, Samaria and Gaza."" It did not say when the policy change would take effect, nor did it say how long it might take to implement it.",0

3230,Floods peak in Paris as France sees worst rains in 50 years,"French President Francois Hollande has declared a state of emergency in the worst-hit areas of the country as the death toll from the floods rose to more than 1,000.
Hollande said the government was mobilising all available resources, including the army and air force, to tackle the crisis, which is expected to last for several days. He said he had asked the prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, and interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve to form a cabinet committee to deal with the situation. The government has also called on the public to help by donating food, water and other supplies. ""This is a national emergency,"" Hollande said in a televised address to the nation, adding that he was ""deeply saddened"" by the loss of life and the damage caused to property and infrastructure. A spokesman for the interior ministry, Pierre-Henry Brandet, said: ""The situation is very serious. There is no doubt that this is the most serious disaster in France since the Second World War."" He added that the number of people who had been evacuated from their homes had risen to 1.5 million, up from 1 million a day earlier. Flooding has been blamed for at least two deaths in northern France, where the River Seine has swollen to its highest level since records began in 1851.
The floods have also forced the closure of schools, hospitals and government offices across France. In the south-eastern city of Toulouse, a school was evacuated after the roof of its building collapsed, while in Marseille, the city's airport was closed after heavy rain caused a runway to sink into the sea. At least one person was killed when a car was swept away by floodwaters on a motorway near the French border with Belgium, according to local media.",0
6425,Steak N’ Burger,"1/2 lb. ground beef, cut into 1/4-inch cubes (or use ground turkey or beef brisket, if you prefer)
2 Tbsp. mayonnaise (optional, but I like it on the tangy side, so I don't bother) (I like to add a little bit of mayo on top of the burger to give it a bit more of a ""cheesy"" flavor, and to make it easier to eat with a fork. You can also add some of your favorite toppings, such as lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, etc. If you like, you can even add in some shredded cheddar cheese and/or sour cream to the mix. I usually add about a cup of shredded cheese to my burger, as well as a few slices of tomato and a handful of lettuce. The burger should be cooked through and the cheese should have melted into the meat. It's best to use a sharp knife to cut the beef into cubes, rather than using a meat grinder or a cheese grater, because it's much easier and faster to do this with the cubes.
""Cheese"" can be any type of cheese, including mozzarella, parmesan, provolone, gruyere, gorgonzola, Swiss, or even feta. (If you're not a fan of cheeses, feel free to omit it from the recipe.) I prefer to cook my burgers in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat for about 8-10 minutes, depending on how tender they are and how hot the skillet is. When the burgers are done, remove them to a paper towel-lined plate and let them rest for a minute or two before serving. They are best eaten right away, though they will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. To reheat them, place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake at 350°F for 15-20 minutes or until the edges are golden brown and bubbly. Enjoy! Recipe Notes *You can use any kind of ground meat for this recipe. For example, ground pork, chicken, turkey, veal, lamb, beef or any other meat that you'd like.

196,Syrian Government Blames Power Cuts on Militants,"Syrian President Bashar al-Assad blamed the country's power cuts on ""terrorists"" in a televised address to the nation on Sunday, saying they were a result of the government's military campaign against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group in Syria and Iraq.
Assad said the power cut was caused by a ""terrorist attack"" on a power plant in the eastern province of Deir ez-Zor, which is under the control of ISIL militants. The Syrian president said that the attack was carried out by ""a group of terrorists"" and that it was the first time that such an attack had taken place since the Syrian army began its military operation against ISIL in September 2015. He also accused the United States and its regional allies of supporting the ISIL group, and called on the international community to do more to stop the group's activities. ""This is a terrorist attack,"" Assad said, according to a translation by the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA). ""The terrorists are using electricity as a weapon against us. We will not allow them to use electricity to harm our people."" Assad did not elaborate on what kind of electricity was being cut off, but said it would be restored as soon as possible. In a separate statement, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem also blamed ""terrorism"" for the electricity cut, calling it ""an act of aggression and aggression against Syria."" ""We call on all countries, including the U.S. and Russia, to help us to restore power to Syria,"" he said. Syria has been hit by power outages in recent months as it battles ISIL and other militant groups in its war-ravaged country. Last week, Syria's state news agency SANA reported that power had been cut in Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, Hama, Latakia, Daraa, Idlib and Damascus' suburbs for more than a week. On Saturday, a Syrian military source told the Associated Press that Syrian troops had recaptured the city of Palmyra from ISIL, the militant group that controls large parts of northern and eastern Syria. ISIL is also believed to have taken over the town of Al-Qaryatain, near the border with Iraq, from Syrian government forces earlier this month.",0

2361,Family of convicted rabbi sues for compensation,"The family of a rabbi who was convicted of sexually assaulting a teenage girl has filed a federal lawsuit against the city of New York, alleging that city officials failed to protect the girl from the rabbi's predatory behavior. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, seeks unspecified damages for emotional distress, pain and suffering, loss of consortium, and punitive and exemplary damages. It was filed on behalf of the victim, identified in court documents only as Jane Doe, by the law firm of Cohen Milstein, P.C., and is being represented by attorney David Boies, who is also a partner in the same firm. In a statement, the firm said it was ""pleased"" to be representing the family. ""We are confident that this case will be resolved in a manner that is fair and just for all parties involved,"" the statement said. A spokesman for Mayor Michael Bloomberg declined to comment on the case, citing the pending litigation. According to the suit, which seeks class-action status, Doe was a 16-year-old high school student when she was sexually assaulted by Rabbi Yitzchok Ben-Yehuda, a former student at Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, an ultra-Orthodox yeshiva in New Hyde Park, N.Y. She was the daughter of Rabbi Shmuel Eliyahu and his wife, Shoshana, both of whom are prominent rabbis in their own right. At the time of her assault, Jane was living with her parents in Brooklyn, where she attended a private school and was studying to become a social worker. After the attack, she reported the crime to police, but was told that she could not file a police report because she did not have a driver's license. Jane's parents, however, were able to obtain a court order allowing them to take her to a hospital emergency room for a sexual assault examination. When she arrived at the hospital, doctors discovered that Jane had been raped and had suffered severe injuries to her genital area, including a broken hymen and hemorrhaging from her vagina and rectum, according to court papers. Doctors told Jane that her attacker had penetrated her with his fingers and that he had forced her into oral sex and vaginal intercourse with him. They also told her that the assault had occurred after she had gone out with a group of friends to celebrate her 16th birthday. On the morning of Jan. 13, 2002, at about 8:30 a.m., Jane awoke to find her assailant standing over her, holding her down and forcing his penis into her mouth. He then raped her several more times over the next several hours, until she passed out. Her parents called the police and told them that they believed their daughter was being held against her will by a man who had sexually abused her repeatedly over a period of several months. Police officers responded to an emergency call about the rape and found Jane lying on her bed, covered in blood, with bruises and lacerations across her face, neck, arms, legs and back. As they were interviewing Jane, her father told the officers that his daughter had told him that ""a man had come into the house and forced himself upon her."" The officers asked Jane if she knew who the man was, to which she replied, ""I don't know. I just know that I was raped."" Jane told police that after the incident she went back to sleep and woke up several times during the night, crying and saying that someone was trying to rape her. One of those times was when the assailant was in her bedroom, lying in wait for Jane to come out of bed. During the course of their investigation, police learned that a number of other women had reported similar incidents to them, all of which had taken place in or near the area where the alleged assault took place. Some of these women said they had also been held down by their assailants, while others said that their attackers had raped them while they slept or while the women were in bed with them. Several women also reported being forced to have sex with the men who were allegedly responsible for the assaults, or having their vaginas penetrated with their fingers or a foreign object, such as a tampon or condom. All of this information led police to conclude that there was probable cause to believe that at least two men had committed the crimes. However, because the investigation was still in its early stages, no arrests were made and no charges were brought against any suspects. Two months later, on Feb. 1, 2003, after a series of interviews with Jane and a review of all the available evidence, NYPD detectives interviewed Jane again, this time at her home. This time, they asked her about her sexual history and whether she remembered the events of that night. Although Jane initially denied having had any sexual contact with any man during that time period, when detectives questioned her further she admitted to having",0

1190,Car bomb in Baghdad kills 32," and injures more than 100Iraqi security forces have killed at least 32 people in a car bomb attack in the Iraqi capital, police and medical sources said.
The attack took place on the outskirts of the city of Sadr City, which has been the scene of fierce fighting between government forces and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) militants, the sources told the Associated Press news agency on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media. The attack was carried out by a suicide bomber who blew himself up in front of a police station, they said, adding that the death toll was expected to rise further. Police said they had arrested a suspect in connection with the attack, but gave no further details. A spokesman for Iraq's interior ministry said the bomber was a member of Isil and was believed to have been planning an attack on a Shia mosque in Sadristan, a predominantly Shia district of Baghdad. ""The bomber detonated his explosives when he was stopped at a checkpoint,"" the spokesman, Brigadier General Qassim al-Moussawi, was quoted as saying by the AP. He did not give any details about the suspect's identity or the type of explosives he had used. It was not immediately clear how many people had been killed or injured, or whether there was any connection between the two attacks. Sadrists are a minority sect of Shia Muslims, who make up about 10 per cent of Iraqi society. They have long complained of marginalisation and discrimination under the Shia-led government of Prime Minister Nouri Maliki.",0

It's called the ""Great Gatsby Curve,"" named after the great American novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, in which the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the middle class gets even poorer. And it has a lot to do with the fact that we live in a country where the top 1 percent of the population owns more than half of all the wealth in the country, while the bottom 90 percent owns less than one-tenth of one percent, according to a recent study by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C. The study found that the gap between the richest and poorest Americans has been widening since the late 1970s, when the share of income going to the poorest quintile of Americans was about 20 percentage points lower than it is today. That's a big deal, because it means that for the first time in American history, there are more people living in poverty today than there were at the end of World War II.",0

There were no women in any of our combat units. So I said to myself, well, if there's one thing I know about women, it's that they can do anything a man can, but they don't know how to do it well. They're not very good at it. But I thought, you know what? I'm going to give it a shot. If it doesn't work out, then I'll come back and try it again."" – Lt. Col. Karen L.

.. View Gallery Photos: A Taste of Italy in Washington, D.C. The Italian-American community in the nation's capital has long been a magnet for tourists and residents alike. But now, thanks to a new restaurant and wine bar, the Italian community is getting a taste of its own cuisine, too. And it's bringing Italian fare and wines from around the world with it. ""We wanted to bring Italian food and Italian wine to the Hill,"" says owner and chef David Alonzo, who grew up in a family of Italian immigrants in Arlington, Va., and moved to Washington to study at the University of Maryland. He and his wife, Laura, have been working on the project for about a year, and they hope to open the restaurant by the end of this year. It will be called Alto Vino — Italian for ""Italian"" — and it will feature dishes from Italy, France, Spain, Italy and the U.K., as well as a selection of wines and spirits from all over the globe. (The restaurant will also have a full bar.) ""It's going to be a place where people can come and enjoy their food, their wine and their spirits, without having to leave the neighborhood,"" Almonzo says. In addition to Italian dishes, diners will have the chance to sample a wide variety of international wines, including some from the United States, as part of a partnership with the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America, which will allow customers to pick up a bottle of any wine they want at any time during the day. Altonzo and Laura are also working with a local wine producer to create a wine list that will reflect the region in which the restaurants are located. They're also looking to partner with local wineries and distilleries to make the menu more diverse, with more Italian and French wines on tap and more American and British spirits on draft. As for the wine, they're looking for a blend of reds, whites and rosés, but they'll also be experimenting with different types of grapes, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Pinot Grigio, to see what works best with their menu. For those who want to try their hand at making their own wine at home, there's also a small tasting room where you can try a few bottles of wine before you make your purchase. There's no set opening date yet, so if you're interested in checking it out, you'll have to wait a little while longer.",0

5343,Historic Las Vegas neon signs set to shine bright once again," Copyright by KRON - All rights reserved VideoLAS VEGAS (KRON) -- It's been a long time coming, but it's finally going to happen. The iconic neon sign at the intersection of Tropicana Avenue and Flamingo Road will be lit up for the first time in more than a decade. It was originally lit in the late '80s and early '90s as part of the city's ""Las Vegas Lights"" campaign, which aimed to promote tourism and tourism-related businesses. But the signs were never properly maintained, and they were eventually taken down in 2003. Now, they're being restored to their former glory and ready to be put back on display. ""It's a great opportunity for us to bring the neon back to its original glory,"" said Mike Bohn, president and CEO of MGM Resorts International, the company that owns and operates the hotel and casino that houses the sign. He said the project is expected to take about a year to complete and cost about $1.5 million to $2 million, depending on the number of signs that need to come down and the cost of replacing them. Bynon said it will take a few months to get the new signs up and running, with the goal of having them up by the end of this year.",0

Many of them are now living in refugee camps in neighboring countries, including Turkey and Jordan, where they are often forced to live in squalid conditions. For the most part, they have been able to find work, but there are still many who are unable to do so because of a lack of education, language skills, or other barriers.

2280,Murder-suicide suspected in fatal Jerusalem fire,"A man suspected of killing his wife and two children in a fire at their home in the West Bank city of Hebron has been shot dead by security forces, the army said on Sunday.
The body of the man, identified by his family as Muhammad Abu Khdeir, 22, was found in his home on Saturday night, a day after he was shot and killed by Israeli forces during a raid on the family's home, according to a statement from the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and the Shin Bet security service, which is leading the investigation into the fire.
 the statement said that the body had been handed over to the Palestinian medical examiner's office for an autopsy, but that it was not immediately clear whether the cause of death was a homicide or a suicide, or whether there was any connection between the two. The IDF did not say whether it had arrested any suspects in connection with the case, nor did it provide further details about the circumstances surrounding the shooting or the identities of any of those who were believed to have been present during the incident. ""The investigation is ongoing,"" the IDF said in its statement, adding that an investigation was under way to determine whether any criminal charges would be brought against anyone involved.

It's been a long time coming, but Kendrick Lamar has finally released his long-awaited follow-up to To Pimp a Butterfly. It's called DAMN., and it's an album that feels like it was made for a different era, one in which hip-hop wasn't as popular as it is now. The album's title is a play on the word ""damn,"" which is used to describe something that's ""unforgivable"" or ""out of control."" It also refers to the state of being in a relationship with someone who doesn't want to be there, or to a situation where you feel like you can't do anything about it. In other words, it describes a lot of what we're dealing with right now in the music industry, and in our culture as a whole. But it also seems like a fitting title for this album, which features some of Kendrick's best songs to date, including ""HUMBLE.,"" ""King Kunta,"" ""Alright"" and ""Swimming Pools (Drank)"" — all of which are among the best in his discography. And, of course, there's also ""DUCKWORTH.,"" one of his most popular songs of all time, as well as ""i,"" a song that has become a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. Kendrick has said that he wanted to make a record that was ""for everybody,"" and he's certainly succeeded in that regard.",0

Herath's availability will come as a huge relief to the Sri Lankans as they have been without the services of their all-rounder for almost a month now. He has not played a Test match since November last year, when he injured his shoulder in a T20I against New Zealand in Colombo. His absence has forced the selectors to look for a replacement, and it appears that the right-hander is the man to fill the void left by the departed batsmen.",0

5:30 p.m.
. The Ukrainian military says it has killed a Russian journalist in the eastern city of Luhansk, where separatists have been fighting government troops for more than a week. It says the journalist was killed by a mortar shell fired from a government position near the town of Krasnyi Luch, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of the rebel stronghold of Donetsk. He was identified by the Russian news agency RIA Novosti as Anton Voloshin, a correspondent for the Moscow-based Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper who had been covering the conflict in eastern Ukraine for about a year. A statement from the military said the reporter was a member of a group of journalists who were on assignment when they were attacked by ""armed militants."" The statement did not say who fired the mortar, but it said it was fired by an ""unknown person"" and that the journalists were unharmed. There was no immediate comment from Russia's Foreign Ministry, which has repeatedly called for an end to the fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists. Ukraine's acting President Oleksandr Turchynov said in a televised address that he had ordered a full investigation into the incident. ""I have ordered the investigation to be carried out as quickly as possible,"" he said, adding that it could take up to two weeks to complete the probe. Russia has denied sending troops or weapons to help the separatists, and has accused Ukraine of fomenting the violence by sending in troops and weapons from outside the country. In a separate development, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko says he will ask the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe to send a mission to Ukraine to investigate reports that Russian troops are fighting alongside the rebels. That would be the first time an OSCE mission has been sent to a conflict zone since the organization was established in 1999. Porphynsky said he would also ask Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine and to stop sending weapons and troops into Ukraine, as well as to allow international monitors to monitor the cease-fire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons, including tanks and armored personnel carriers, from Ukrainian territory. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of arming and training the separatist forces, while Russia denies the accusations and says its forces are only there to protect Russian citizens and compatriots who live in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula annexed by Russia in March. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov says Russia is ready to hold talks with the Ukrainian leadership to discuss the crisis. But he also says Moscow will not recognize the results of Sunday's presidential election, in which President Viktor Yanukovych fled to Russia after months of protests against his decision to back away from signing an EU trade deal with Ukraine in favor of closer ties with Russia. Yanukovych was ousted in February after weeks of street protests that were sparked by his refusal to sign the EU deal and a decision by parliament to strip him of his powers.

4256,Mark Hamill Opens Up About His Friendship With Carrie Fisher," By Kristy Puchko Random Article Blend Star Wars: The Force Awakens. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, actor Harrison Ford, who played Han Solo in the original trilogy, opened up about the friendship he had with his co-star.
In the interview, Ford was asked about his relationship with Fisher, and how he felt about her leaving the franchise. He responded by saying,""She was a great friend of mine. She was one of the best people I ever had the pleasure of working with. We had a lot of fun together. It's a shame that she's not with us anymore, but I'm sure she would have loved to have worked with me again. I wish her the very best in whatever she does next. But I don't know what's going to happen, I just know that I'll always have a special place in my heart for her. And that's all I can really say about that. ""It's hard to say goodbye to someone you've known for a long time, especially someone who's been with you for as long as I have. That's the hardest thing to do, is to let go of someone that you love so much. You know, it's like you're losing a part of yourself, you know? And you just have to find a way to deal with it, because you can't let it get to you. So I've just got to keep going and keep trying to make the world a better place for everyone.""
.@HarrisonFord on his friendship with @carrieffisher: ""I've always loved her as a person and as an actress."" pic.twitter.com/X9hfVqhYJf — TheHollywood Reporter (@THR) December 6, 2015
, the actor said that he and Fisher were ""very close"" and that they had ""a lot in common."" He went on to add, ""We were very good friends, very close friends."" When asked if he was sad to see her go, he said, ""[I'm] not sad at all. There's nothing sad about it. The only thing sad is that we didn't work together as much as we should have."" Ford also spoke about how much he enjoyed working on the film, saying that it was ""one of my favorite movies of all time."" The actor also revealed that Fisher was the first person he called when he got the call to join the cast of The Last Jedi, which is set to hit theaters on December 15, 2017. Ford said he told her he loved the movie and asked her if she wanted to come along for the ride. When she said yes, they went to lunch together and then went back to the set, where they shot the scenes that would make up the climactic battle between the Resistance and the First Order.When asked what he thought of Fisher's departure from the series, Ford responded,The actor was also asked whether or not he would be interested in reprising his role as Luke Skywalker in any future films, to which he responded with a simple ""no."" However, when the interviewer asked him if there was any chance he could return to play the character in a future film or TV series, his response was more of a ""maybe"" rather than an ""absolutely not.""When it came time for Ford to talk about what the future holds for him and his character, there were a few things that stood out to him. One of those things was that there is a possibility that Ford could be playing a different character than the one he played in The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi. While Ford did not reveal which character he is playing at the moment, one thing that did stand out was his excitement for playing the role of Kylo Ren, a character that has been rumored to be in development for quite some time now.Ford also addressed the rumors that have been floating around the internet regarding the possibility of him returning to his original role, stating that ""there's no truth to those rumors at this point in time,"" but he did say that if they ever do come to fruition, then he will be ""honored"" to reprise his iconic role.As for when we might see Ford back in action onscreen, we're still waiting to hear back from Disney and Lucasfilm on that front. As of right now, all we have is Ford's words, so we'll keep you updated as more information becomes available.

The group, which is based in Washington, D.C., released a new report on Tuesday that calls for more funding for community-based programs that help people who have mental illness. It also calls on the federal government to make it easier to get treatment for those who need it. ""We need to do a better job of helping people get the help they need,"" said Dr. Michael Siegel, the report's lead author and a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, in a phone interview with All Things Considered host Audie Cornish. He's also the co-director of Columbia's Center for Health Policy and Clinical Practice and the director of research at the Institute for Clinical and Translational Science, a non-profit organization that works to improve the health and well-being of individuals and communities. Sennholz and his colleagues looked at data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which collects information about people's behaviors and health status. They found that the number of people in the United States with a mental disorder has increased by more than 50 percent over the past 30 years, and that nearly half of those people have a diagnosable disorder, such as depression, anxiety or bipolar disorder. In addition, nearly one in five people ages 18 to 24 has experienced a major depressive episode at some point in their lives, according to the study, published in JAMA Psychiatry. That's up from less than one-third of that age group in 1990, when the CDC first started collecting data on mental disorders. And the rate of suicide has also increased, from about one per 100,000 people to about 1.5 in 1 million people over that same time period. What's more, there's a lot of variation in how people are treated for their mental illnesses. For example, some states have laws that allow for involuntary commitment to a psychiatric hospital, while others don't. Some states, like New Jersey, have no laws at all about involuntary hospitalization. But there are also many states that have some kind of law that allows for a person to be involuntarily committed if they are deemed a danger to themselves or others, or if a court finds that they pose a risk of harm to others. There's no national standard for what constitutes a ""danger to self"" or ""risk of harming others,"" but there is a federal standard, called the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Act, that requires states to report crimes committed by someone who is mentally ill to local law enforcement, who then must report the crime to federal authorities. This means that if someone commits a crime that is classified as a misdemeanor in one state, but a felony in another, they will be reported to both the state and federal governments. If a state doesn't have an UCR Act-compliant reporting system, it will have to rely on reporting by local police departments to determine whether or not the person is in fact a threat to himself or herself or other people. So, for instance, if you commit a violent crime in California, you could be arrested and sent to jail for up to six months, depending on whether you're a first-time offender or a repeat offender. You could also be charged with violating a restraining order, even if the order was issued by a judge and you didn't know that you were violating it until after you committed your crime. These laws are meant to protect the public and to prevent people from committing crimes they wouldn't otherwise be able to commit. However, many of these laws have been challenged in court, with some courts ruling that people can be held in jail even when they're not committing any crimes, because they've been found to pose an ""imminent threat of serious physical harm."" In other cases, courts have ruled that police can arrest someone without a warrant simply because he or she has a history of violence against others or is considered a high-risk person for committing violent crimes. As a result, police officers are increasingly being called in to deal with people they think might be dangerous, rather than",0

The suit was filed in New York state court on behalf of a number of Israeli citizens, who say they have been denied entry to the US because they were born in a country that does not recognize Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state.
The suit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), alleges that Israel discriminates against non-Jews by denying them entry into the country. It also claims that the Israeli government has failed to protect the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel, including the right of Palestinians to travel freely to and from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as the freedom of movement of the Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem, which Israel has occupied since 1967. In addition, the suit says that Israeli authorities have refused to grant residency permits to Palestinians who have lived in Israel for more than five years, and have denied them access to government services, such as health care and education, that are available to Israelis. According to a press release issued by CCR, ""Israel's discriminatory policies and practices against Palestinians are a violation of international law and a breach of its obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), to which it is a signatory."" The lawsuit seeks a court order that would require Israel to comply with international human rights standards. ""This is the first time that a lawsuit has been filed against Israel in an American court for its discriminatory treatment of foreign nationals based on their national origin,"" said Hillel Neuer, executive director of The Israel Project (TIP), which is representing the plaintiffs. TIP is an organization that advocates for Israel and its citizens. A spokesperson for the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) told Haaretz that it had not yet been served with the lawsuit and could not comment on it at this time. However, MFA spokesperson Emmanuel Nahshon said that ""the government is committed to upholding the principle of equal treatment for all its residents, regardless of nationality or religion."" ""The government takes all possible measures to ensure the security and well-being of all Israeli residents,"" he added.",0

He says it's hard to make ends meet when he and his wife have to work two or three jobs just to pay the bills. ""It's a lot of hard work,"" he says, ""and I don't want to do it anymore."" John is one of many truck drivers who say they're frustrated with the high cost of living in the neighborhood where they live and work. They say there's not enough work to go around, and that they can't afford to buy a home in their neighborhood, even though the median home price is about $200,000.
The truckers are part of a growing group of people who are struggling to get by in a neighborhood that has been booming in recent years. In the past few years, the area has seen an influx of new residents, many of them young professionals, who have moved in to take advantage of the city's booming economy. But the boom has come at the expense of nearby residents like John. The area is home to a number of high-end restaurants and shops, but it also has a high concentration of low-income and working-class residents. Many of those residents have been forced to move out of their homes because of rising rents and other costs. John says that's made it hard for him to keep up with his mortgage payments and keep his trucking business going. Now, he worries that he won't be able to afford a house in this neighborhood any time soon. His wife is pregnant with their second child, which means they'll need to find a new place to live soon, too. And they say that even if they could afford it, it would be difficult for them to save enough money to put down a down payment on their own home.",0

6682,Suspect Arrested In Death Of N. Korean Dictator's Half-Brother,"Enlarge this image toggle caption Kim Hong-Ji/AFP/Getty Images Kim Yong-joon/Reuters/Landov Kim Jong-un's half-brother, Jang Song Thaek, has been arrested in connection with the assassination of his half brother, North Korea's leader, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap. Kim is accused of being the mastermind behind the killing, which was carried out by a North Korean agent. (Yonhap) Kim's arrest is the latest in a series of high-profile arrests in the North in recent months. The North's state media reported that Kim was arrested at his home in Pyongyang on Tuesday. He is being held at the Pyongyang Detention Center, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported, citing a source close to the investigation. ""Kim is suspected of having masterminded the murder,"" the agency said, adding that he had been under investigation for the past two years. North and South Korea are technically still at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. But the two Koreas are now technically at peace because of a truce that ended the war in 1953, and the U.N. Security Council approved a new round of sanctions against Pyongyang earlier this month. In addition to Kim, two other suspects have been detained: Kim Kyong-hui, who is believed to be the head of the Korean Workers' Party's Central Committee; and Ri Su-yong, a former vice minister of foreign affairs and a close confidant of Kim. Ri was detained in March and is now in custody at a prison camp in North Hamgyong Province, where he is serving a life sentence for his role in an assassination attempt on the late Kim Il Sung in 1994. A third suspect, Kim Dong-chul, was sentenced to life in prison last year for plotting to overthrow the government. His wife, Ri Sol-ju, is also in jail, but she has not been charged with any crime. Both Ri and Kim are in their mid-40s, with a combined age of more than 60. They are the second and third members of their family to die under mysterious circumstances since Kim took power in late 2011, after his father's death from a heart attack.",0

The two leaders also discussed the Paris climate accord, the U.S. withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and North Korea's missile and nuclear programs. Trump said he was ""very disappointed"" with the deal. ""I think it's a terrible deal,"" he said, adding, ""We're going to see what happens with that."" Macron, meanwhile, said the accord was a ""historic mistake"" and that he would seek to renegotiate it. The French president also said that France would not be bound by the terms of the agreement if it were to leave the European Union, a move that has been widely interpreted as a threat to the bloc's future. Macron's comments came as he and Trump held their first face-to-face meeting since Trump took office on Jan. 20. In the Oval Office, Trump praised Macron for his ""tremendous leadership"" during his first year in office. He also praised the French leader for ""doing a great job."" ""He's doing a very good job,"" Trump told reporters after the meeting, according to a pool report. But he added that ""we have a lot of work to do"" to improve relations between the two countries. On the subject of climate change, both leaders said they were committed to working toward a global agreement to limit global warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. They also agreed to work together to combat the spread of deadly diseases such as Zika and dengue fever, as well as other threats to public health. During their joint press conference, however, neither Trump nor Macron offered any details on how they would achieve that goal, other than to say that both countries would work toward the goal of limiting the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F). ""The Paris agreement is very unfair at the highest level,"" Macron said of Trump's decision to pull out of it, referring to his decision in June to exit the landmark climate agreement reached by nearly 200 countries in Paris in December 2015. France and other countries have vowed to keep the world's average temperature from rising more than 2 C above the preindustrial level, and to pursue efforts to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, among other things. While the Trump administration has said it will leave in place a number of Obama-era climate regulations, including the Clean Power Plan, it has not said how it plans to replace them with its own policies. A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the administration is considering a range of options for how to move forward on climate policy, but that no final decisions have been made. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said in an interview with Le Figaro newspaper published Wednesday that his country would continue to push for an international agreement that would keep global temperature rise below the 2-degree Celsius threshold, saying it was the only way to avoid the worst effects of rising sea levels, droughts and extreme weather events. However, he did not elaborate on what that agreement might look like or whether it would include a cap on carbon emissions. Asked about the possibility of a Paris-style agreement in his meeting with Trump in Washington, D.C., earlier this month, French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said: ""It's not a question of whether we will or we won't. We will do everything we can to make sure that Paris is a success."" In a separate interview Wednesday with France's Le Monde newspaper, Philippe reiterated his government's commitment to Paris, calling it the ""only solution"" for the global climate crisis. Philippe, who is on a two-day visit to Washington to meet with his American counterpart, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson Rex Wayne TillersonTurkey-Russia Idlib agreement: A lessons learned from Iraq's war for Syrian rebels Jordan wants Rosenstein to testify before House Judiciary Committee Kamala Harris calls for Senate to protect Mueller probe as Rosenstein faces potential dismissal MORE, also called on other nations to follow the lead of France in committing to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. That would be a significant increase from current levels of about 26 percent, or about 2.8 billion metric tons of CO2 equivalent, that are projected to be emitted by developed nations in that timeframe, Le Parisien reported. Le Franceien also quoted Philippe as saying that Trump had told him in a phone call last week that there was no need for France to commit to",0

430,Russia's Putin lands in Egypt in sign of growing ties," between Moscow and the Arab worldRussian President Vladimir Putin landed in Cairo on Sunday, the first visit by a Russian leader to the Middle East since the end of the Cold War.
Putin, who is on a two-day visit to Egypt, is expected to meet with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Monday and then travel to Saudi Arabia, where he is due to attend a summit of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) leaders on Tuesday. He will then return to Moscow for a meeting with his Russian counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev, on Wednesday. Putin's visit comes at a time when relations between Russia and Egypt are at their lowest point in decades, with the two countries at loggerheads over a number of issues, including the war in Syria and Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014. Russia has also been accused of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group that Sisi's government accuses of being a terrorist organisation. The Kremlin has denied the allegations, saying it supports the Egyptian government's efforts to fight terrorism. ""I am very happy to be here,"" Putin said in a brief statement after landing at Cairo airport, according to state news agency RIA Novosti, adding that he was looking forward to meeting his Egyptian counterpart and discussing ""all issues of mutual interest"". ""We have a lot of common interests,"" he said, ""including in the fight against terrorism and extremism, and we are ready to work together to achieve these goals."" Putin also said he hoped the visit would be a ""positive step"" for Egypt's relations with Russia, which have been strained in recent years over the conflict in eastern Ukraine and Moscow's support for the Syrian regime of Bashar Al-Assad. Egypt has been a key ally of Russia in its efforts against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, as well as in fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. But relations have soured since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014, a move condemned by the West as a violation of international law and a threat to international peace and security. In a speech in Moscow last month, Putin accused the US and its allies of trying to ""destabilise"" Russia by supporting ""extremist forces"" in Ukraine. Moscow has repeatedly denied accusations that it has sent troops and weapons to support pro-Russian separatists in east Ukraine, but has acknowledged that some of its military personnel have fought alongside the rebels.",0

 the Russian Foreign Ministry said that Putin and Sisi had agreed to hold a working visit to Russia in the first half of 2016. The visit will take place in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Vladivostok, and will be followed by a meeting of Russian and Egyptian business leaders. Putin will also visit Egypt's Red Sea resorts of Sharm El-Sheikh and Hurghada, as well as the Suez Canal city of Ismailia, where he will attend the opening ceremony of a Russian-built nuclear power plant. ""The visit of President Putin to Egypt is an important step in strengthening Russia-Egypt relations,"" the ministry said, adding that the visit was also aimed at strengthening cooperation between Russia and Egypt on regional and international issues. Russia's relations with Egypt have been strained since the ouster of former President Mohamed Morsi in July 2013, after mass protests against his rule. Since then, relations between Moscow and Cairo have deteriorated, with Moscow accusing Cairo of not doing enough to stop the flow of weapons to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Egypt has also accused Russia of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group that has been outlawed in Russia.",0

 the number is the highest since the IOH began keeping records in 2009. The increase is due to a combination of factors, including the closure of the so-called ""Gulf of Aqaba"" route, which had been the main way for migrants to reach Europe, as well as an increase in people attempting the crossing from North Africa and the Middle East, the report said. It added that the death toll could have been even higher had it not been for the rescue efforts of NGOs such as Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors without Borders/Médicins sans Frontieres, or MSF), which have helped save the lives of thousands of people in recent years.

""The Fed's decision to begin the unwinding of the massive balance sheets of Wall Street banks and other financial institutions is an important step in the right direction, but it is not enough. The Fed must do more to ensure that the financial system is resilient to future economic shocks. This is why I have introduced the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) Act, which would create a new federal agency to oversee the nation's largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The FSOC would have the authority to require banks to hold more capital in case of a financial crisis. It would also be able to impose additional capital requirements on banks that fail to meet their capital standards.""

""We are working with the police, fire and rescue services and other agencies to assess the extent of damage caused by the flooding,"" the statement said.

3639,2 state solution optional? Palestinians puzzled by US view," of Israeli-Palestinian peace talksJERUSALEM (AP) — The U.S. State Department said Monday that it is ""deeply troubled"" by the Israeli government's plan to build 3,000 new housing units in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, saying it would undermine the prospects for a two-state solution to the decades-old conflict. The announcement came a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he would not seek a peace deal with the Palestinians, a move that was widely seen as an attempt to appease hard-liners in his right-wing Likud party. ""The United States is deeply troubled by this decision, and we urge the government of Israel to reverse it immediately,"" said spokeswoman Jen Psaki in a statement. She added that the Obama administration ""will continue to work with Israel and the international community to advance peace and security for both Israelis and Palestinians."" The new units would be built on privately owned Palestinian land, she said, adding that they would ""serve no purpose other than to further inflame tensions and undermine efforts to achieve a just, lasting and comprehensive peace between the parties."" She said the plan was ""unhelpful and counterproductive to achieving peace"" and that ""it is not in Israel's national security interest to continue with this plan."" Netanyahu has said he will not accept a Palestinian state in any of the territories captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. He has also said that any peace agreement would have to be based on the pre-1967 lines, which Israel considers its ""eternal and indivisible"" capital. Palestinians seek the creation of an independent state of their own, along the lines of what they call the ""67 lines,"" which were drawn up by Egypt, Syria and Jordan after the war. Israel captured the Gaza Strip from Jordan in 1967 and annexed it in 1981. In recent years, Israel has built hundreds of new homes on land that Palestinians claim for their future state. Some of those homes have been built in disputed areas, including the eastern part of Jerusalem known as the Old City, where Palestinians want to establish a city that would become the capital of a future independent Palestinian nation. Netanyahu's announcement on Monday came after he met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah on Sunday. During the meeting, Netanyahu told Abbas that his government was ready to resume peace negotiations, but only if the Palestinian leadership agreed to recognize Israel as a Jewish state with a capital in Jerusalem. Abbas, in turn, said",0

 the monument is located in the heart of the Black Hills of South Dakota. The monument, which was created by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906, is the only one of its kind in North America. It's also the first monument to be designated by the Antiquities Act, a 1906 law that gives the president the power to create national monuments. In a statement, the group said it was ""deeply disappointed"" with the decision, and that it ""will continue to fight for the protection of this land and its cultural and natural resources for future generations."" The group also called on President Trump to ""immediately rescind this monument designation and immediately begin the process of reviewing all national monument designations to ensure that they are in keeping with our nation's values and the best interests of all Americans."" It also said that if Trump does not rescind the designation, it will file a lawsuit in federal court to stop the federal government from taking any action on the land until the case is resolved. ""We are deeply disappointed that the Trump administration has chosen to ignore the voices of millions of Americans who have spoken out in opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline,"" the statement said, referring to a pipeline that would carry crude oil from the Bakken oil fields of North Dakota to Patoka, Ill., where it would be loaded onto tankers for shipment to refineries in Texas and other U.S. Gulf Coast states. A coalition of Native American tribes and environmental groups, including the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, have been protesting the pipeline for months, saying it threatens their water supply and sacred sites. They say the project would pollute the Missouri River and desecrate sacred burial sites, among other concerns. Trump signed an executive order in April that directed the Interior Department to review and potentially rescind all of President Obama's executive actions on climate change. He also directed Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to find a way to expedite the permitting process for oil and gas drilling on federal lands.

The lawsuit, which was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Center for Individual Rights in Education (CIRTE) on behalf of more than 1,000 students, parents, and educators, alleges that Education Secretary Arne Duncan violated the Privacy Act of 1974 by illegally obtaining the SSNs and other personal information of over 1.5 million students from the federal government.
According to the complaint, the Education Department has been collecting and using the information for years without the knowledge or consent of the student or his or her parent or legal guardian. It also claims that Duncan has violated federal law by failing to obtain a court order to stop the collection and use of student data without a warrant or court-issued subpoena. In addition, it claims the department has failed to comply with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which requires the government to provide information on the number of requests for student information it has received and how many of those requests were granted.

The research, published in PLOS ONE, is the first time that archaeologists have been able to document the existence of such a society, which is thought to have flourished between A.D. 800 and 900.
The research team, led by UC Berkeley professor of archaeology and director of the UC Museum of Paleontology, used a combination of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and high-resolution 3-D imaging to map the Maya landscape. They found that the landscape was dominated by a series of large, flat-topped canyons, some of which were more than 1,000 feet (300 meters) in diameter. In addition, the researchers found the remains of several large Maya cities, including the city of Huaca Prieta, as well as a number of smaller Maya settlements, such as the town of San Cristobal de las Casas, and a small Maya village near the site of El Castillo, a Maya city that was destroyed by the Spanish conquistadors in 1521.

4970,Polish priest set for sainthood criticized for anti-Semitism,"(ANSAmed) - ROME, FEBRUARY 19 - A Polish priest who was the subject of an international outcry for his comments about the Holocaust has been named a saint by the Vatican.
Father Zygmunt Krychowiak, who died in 2006, was canonized by Pope John Paul II on Wednesday. He is the first Polish saint to be canonised since the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s, and is one of only a handful of Polish saints to have received the honor. The Vatican said in a statement that the canonization was ""a great honor for the Polish people and the Catholic Church."" The Polish government has also expressed its gratitude to the pope for canonizing the priest, saying it was a sign of ""solidarity"" between the two countries. ""This is a very important day for Poland,"" Prime Minister Donald Tusk said at a press conference in Warsaw, adding that it would be a ""sign of solidarity between Poland and Pope Francis."" ""We are very grateful to him for this decision,"" he said. Tushar Tewari, a member of Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, said that ""the pope's decision to canonize a Polish martyr of the 20th century is an important step forward for Polish-Catholic relations."" Tawari added that he hoped the new saint would help ""strengthen the bonds of brotherhood between Poles and Catholics around the world."" In an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt published in 2000, the then-archbishop of Krakow, Stanisław Dziwisz, criticized the Nazis for their treatment of Jews, calling them ""enemies of God."" He also said the Jews were ""unworthy of life"" and that they should be exterminated. In the interview, which was translated into English, he also referred to Jews as ""cockroaches,"" and said: ""They are not human beings, they are vermin. They have no rights, no dignity and no place in this world. We have to exterminate them."" After the article was published, Polish President Lech Kaczyński condemned the remarks and called for an investigation into the archbishop's actions. A few days later, Krasznahorkai was removed from his position as bishop of Poznan, where he had presided over the diocese for more than 20 years. His successor, Archbishop Stanislaw",0

(Kundalini: I am a woman, I have a husband, he is a man. I don't know what to do. What should I do? What am I supposed to say? How can I tell him that I love him, that he's my husband? I can't do that. He doesn't love me, and I'm not his wife, so how can he tell me that? It's not right, it's wrong. If I say that, then he'll say, ""Oh, you're not my wife. You're just a girl."" And that's the end of it. So I just want to be left alone. And I want him to leave me alone, too. But he won't, because he loves me and he wants me to stay with him. That's how it is, isn't it? He's a good man, but he has a problem with me. It makes me sad, really, when I see him like this. When I look at him and see how he treats me like a piece of meat, like he does to all the other women in the village. Because I know that if I go to the police and tell them what's going on, they'll just laugh at me because they're all so stupid. They're so ignorant about this kind of thing. All they know is what they've been told by their parents and their teachers and what their elders have told them. The only thing they have to go on are the stories that they heard from their mothers and grandmothers and so on. There's nothing they can do about it, is there? So they just keep on telling the same stories over and over again, until they get tired of hearing them and they go away and go back to their own homes, which is the only way to get rid of this problem. Now, what do you think? Do you have any ideas about how to deal with this situation? (Laughter) I think you should just leave it alone and let it go. Don't try to make it any better or any worse. Just go and live your life as normal as you can, just like everyone else in this village does. No matter what you do, no matter who you are or where you come from, there's no way you'll ever be able to change the fact that you live in a village where there are so many women who have been raped and who are afraid to come out of their houses and talk to anyone about what has happened to them because of the shame and the stigma that comes with being a victim of sexual violence. As long as there is this stigma attached to being raped, women will never come forward to report the crime, even if they are raped by a relative or a neighbor or by someone who is not their husband or father or husband's brother or brother's son or son's boyfriend or boyfriend's girlfriend or girlfriend's mother or mother's sister or sister's daughter or daughter's granddaughter or granddaughter's aunt or aunt's niece or niece's nephew or nephew's uncle or uncle's cousin or cousin's friend or friend's wife or wife's lover or lover's partner or partner's spouse or spouse's child or child's parent or parent's grandchild or grandparent's grandson or grandson's great-grandchild, or anyone else who might be a potential victim. Even if the person who raped you is your brother, your father's best friend, someone you've known for a long time, somebody who's been in your house for years and years, who has been your friend for many, many years—even if that person is an acquaintance of yours—it's still not going to stop you from coming forward and telling your story. In fact, the more you tell the story the worse it will get for you and for the people around you because you will be blamed for everything that happens to you, including the rape itself. People will think that it was your fault for not reporting it sooner, for being too scared or too embarrassed or whatever it may be. After all, if you didn't report it when you were a little girl and you",0

The article was published on July 23, 2014, and has since been widely circulated on social media. In the article, which was written in response to the publication of a report by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the PA's Minister of Prisoners' Affairs, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, was quoted as saying that the three teenagers were killed because they were ""terrorists"" and that their deaths were a ""crime against humanity."" The three teens, Eyal Yifrach, Gilad Shaar and Naftali Fraenkel, were shot and killed by Israeli forces on June 12, 2012, while hitchhiking near the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba, near Hebron. Their bodies were found the next day in a shallow grave. Israeli authorities have not been charged with any crime in connection with the killings, but they have been accused of using excessive force against the teenagers and of failing to protect them from the violence of Israeli settlers. According to a UN report released in December 2013, at least 1,200 Palestinians have died in Israeli military operations since the beginning of 2014.

2598,Former Australian PM: Move embassy to J'lem,"AUSTRALIAN Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said he would move the Australian embassy in Jerusalem to the city's Old City if he becomes prime minister, in a move that would be seen as a major diplomatic blow to Israel.
Abbott made the comments in an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald published on Wednesday. He said the move would not be taken lightly, but that it was the right thing to do for the country's relationship with Israel and the Jewish people. ""I think it's right for Australia to have a presence in the holy city of Jerusalem,"" he said, adding that he did not want to see the embassy moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, where it is currently based. The move, which would require the approval of the United Nations Security Council, would mark the first time Australia has moved its embassy since the end of World War II. It would also mark a significant shift in Australia's foreign policy towards Israel, a country that has long been viewed with suspicion by the international community. Israel's ambassador to Australia, Ron Prosor, told the Herald that Abbott's comments were ""unfortunate"" and that the government had no plans to change the status quo at the Israeli-occupied West Bank city. But pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC welcomed the announcement, calling it a ""historic day"". ""This is a historic day for Israel,"" the group's chief executive, Jonathan Greenblatt, said at a press conference in New York on Thursday. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said she was ""delighted"" to hear the news, and called on the Abbott government to follow through on its promise to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.",0

Israeli police raid homes in West Bank, arrest 15 Palestinians for 'incitement' to violence
... Israeli police on Sunday raided the homes of 15 Palestinian youths in the occupied East Jerusalem district of Silwan, and arrested them on suspicion of inciting violence, according to the Palestinian Prisoner's Society (PPS). The PPS said in a statement that the youths were arrested for ""inciting violence and incitement against the state of Israel."" The statement said the arrests were carried out on the orders of the Shin Bet security service, which is responsible for monitoring the activities of Palestinian youth in Jerusalem. The arrests came a day after a Palestinian teenager was shot and killed by an Israeli settler in Silwad, near the city of Ramallah, in what police said was an ""accidental"" shooting. Police said they were investigating the incident as a possible ""terror attack."".... In a separate incident, Israeli forces raided a home in Beit Ummar, south of Nablus, where they arrested a 16-year-old Palestinian boy for allegedly throwing stones at Israeli soldiers. He was taken to an unknown location for interrogation, the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem said. In the same area, police also raided an apartment in al-Khalil, east of Hebron, for alleged stone-throwing. No arrests have been made in either of these cases..... Israeli authorities have arrested more than 1,000 Palestinians since the beginning of October, including at least 100 minors, over allegations of stone throwing, Molotov cocktail attacks and other acts of violence against Israeli civilians and security forces, Human Rights Watch said today. Israel's policy of arresting and detaining Palestinians without charge or trial is a violation of international law and a breach of its obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Israel should immediately release all Palestinian prisoners and end its practice of holding Palestinians in administrative detention without charges or trials. It should also ensure that all detainees are promptly charged with a criminal offense and that they receive prompt access to legal counsel. Israeli officials should release information about the number of Palestinians being held incommunicado, as well as details about their conditions of detention, such as the reason for their detention and whether they are being charged or are awaiting trial. Palestinian authorities should allow access by independent monitors to all locations where Palestinians are held in Israeli prisons. They should ensure the release of all Palestinians who have not been convicted of a crime and who are not facing charges of terrorism or other serious crimes. All Palestinian detainees should be released immediately and unconditionally, without any conditions or restrictions, to allow them to return to their families and communities in accordance with their rights under international humanitarian law (IHL) and their right to freedom from torture and ill-treatment. Prisoners should not be subjected to prolonged solitary confinement or to any form of physical or psychological abuse.
The Israeli government should end the practice, known as ""administrative detention,"" in which Palestinians suspected of involvement in attacks against Israelis are detained for months or even years without being formally charged, tried, or convicted. Such detentions are illegal under IHL and violate the rights of detainees to a fair trial and to be free from arbitrary arrest and detention. As a matter of policy, Israel does not permit the transfer of prisoners to third countries, except in exceptional circumstances. However, it is possible for Israel to transfer a prisoner to another country under certain conditions. For example, if the prisoner has been indicted by a court of competent jurisdiction and is serving a sentence of less than five years, he or she can be transferred to his or her home country for up to one year, provided that there are no serious grounds to believe that he will commit a serious crime in that country. A prisoner can also be returned to Israel for a limited period of time for medical treatment or for other humanitarian reasons, subject to approval by the High Court of Justice. Under the Law of Return, all Israeli citizens born on or after June 14, 1948, are eligible to apply for Israeli citizenship upon reaching the age of 18, regardless of whether or not they have ever lived in Israel. Palestinians born in 1948 or later who were not citizens at the time of their birth can apply to become citizens if they meet the following criteria: (1) They were born within the 1949 armistice lines between Israel and Jordan; (2) Their father or mother was a Jordanian citizen; and (3) The child was born before the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. If the child is under 18 years of age, a parent or legal guardian must be present to sign the application. Children born to Palestinian parents who do not have Jordanian citizenship are",0

The average Lithuanian adult drinks an average of 11.5 liters of pure alcohol a year, the WHO says. That's nearly three times as much as the U.S. average, which is 5.6 litors. (The WHO defines alcohol consumption as ""any alcoholic beverage, including beer, wine, spirits, liqueurs, coffee, tea, soft drinks, and other non-alcoholic beverages."") The WHO also notes that Lithuania has one of the lowest life expectancies in Europe, with the average life expectancy at birth in 2012 at just 62.8 years. In the United States, life spans are much longer, at 78.2 years for men and 82.7 for women. Lithuania also has a high rate of drug and alcohol abuse, as well as high rates of teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). In 2012, Lithuania had the second-highest number of STDs per 100,000 people, after Moldova, WHO said in a report released earlier this year. According to a 2013 report by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), Lithuania's drug-related mortality rate was the third highest among the 28 EU member states in 2013, behind only Bulgaria and Romania.

1827,Nevada tops Colorado State 76-67 to cap rough day for Rams,"COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) — The Denver Broncos have lost their last two games by double digits, but they still have a chance to win the AFC West. The Rams, meanwhile, have won two in a row and are on the verge of their first winning season since 2007. They'll try to get back on track Saturday night when they host the Broncos at Sports Authority Field at Mile High. Denver (8-6) has won four of its last five games, including the last three by an average of 17.5 points. But the Rams (7-7) are coming off their most lopsided loss of the season, a 70-0 drubbing at the hands of San Diego on Thursday night. ""We've got to play better,"" Rams coach Jeff Fisher said after his team fell to 0-3 in the second half of back-to-back games for the first time since 2008-09, when the team went 1-4 in those games. It was the fourth time in five seasons that a team has lost its first three games of a season by at least 20 points, and the third time it has done it in as many years. In fact, the only team to do it more than once in that span is the 1999-2000 New England Patriots, who lost three straight to start the year before going on a four-game winning streak that included a Super Bowl appearance. That team was led by future Hall of Famer Tom Brady, now with the New York Jets. This year's Rams are a different team, with a new coach in Sean McVay and a rookie quarterback in Jared Goff. Goff has thrown for 1,845 yards and 10 touchdowns with just one interception in his first two starts. He has also rushed for a career-high 1.9 yards per carry.

In addition, the researchers found a link between the smell of meat and a woman's body mass index (BMI), which is a ratio of weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2). In other words, if you have a BMI of 30 or higher, you're probably not eating a healthy diet, according to the study's lead author, Dr. David Ludwig, an associate professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the UCSF School of Public Health.

Carlos Angel Trevino Morales, a reporter for the Mexican newspaper La Jornada, was arrested in September 2014 and charged with being part of the Sinaloa Cartel, the largest and most powerful drug-trafficking organisation in Mexico. He was held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, before being transferred to a federal prison in Florence, Colorado, where he has remained since his arrest in October 2014. His case has attracted international attention, with the United Nations calling for his immediate and unconditional release. The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has refused to confirm or deny his detention, citing the ongoing investigation into his alleged involvement in the drug trade. However, in a letter to the editor published on the newspaper's website last week, Morales said: ""I am afraid that if I return to my country of origin, I will not be able to live a normal life. I fear for my life and the lives of my family members."" He added that he had not been allowed to see his wife and two children, who are US citizens, since he was taken into custody. ""They have not allowed me to speak with my wife or my children since I was detained,"" he said. In the letter, which was also published in Spanish, he wrote that his family had been forced to leave their home and move into a hotel in order to protect them from the cartel members who had come to their house to threaten them and their family. Morales also said that while in prison, guards had threatened to kill him and his children if they did not pay a bribe of $10,000 (£6,500). ""The guards told me that they would kill me and my kids if we didn't pay the bribe. They said they had a list of people who owed them money, and that I would be on that list."" In a statement, ICE said it was ""aware of Mr Morales' situation"" but declined to comment further. A spokesperson for DHS said the agency could not comment on individual cases, but that ""all individuals are afforded the right to due process under the law, including the presumption of innocence until proven guilty"". The spokesperson said ICE was committed to ""ensuring the safety of",0

Attorney General Mike DeWine's proposed changes would allow police to seize drugs from people suspected of using them to get high.

Korean leader’s half brother,"By Kim Eun-jungSEOUL, South Korea (Yonhap) -- A South Korean man has been arrested on suspicion of killing the half-brother of North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, the South's National Intelligence Service (NIS) said Tuesday.The NIS said the suspect, identified as Kim Dong-chul, was arrested at his home in the southern city of Seongju on Monday.Kim, who is in his 40s, is suspected of having killed Kim Kyong-hui, a North Korean defector who had been living in Seoul for more than a decade, according to the agency.He is being held in a detention center at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, it said, without elaborating on the circumstances of his arrest.It was not immediately clear whether he had a lawyer.North Korea has denied any involvement in Kim's death, saying he died of a heart attack while on a trip to China.South Korea and the U.S. have accused the North of carrying out the killing, which they say was carried out by a disgruntled former employee of the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).The North, however, has repeatedly denied the accusation, calling it a ""fabricated story.""The two Koreas are technically still at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. The North has conducted a series of nuclear and missile tests in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions, including a long-range rocket launch last month that the United States and its allies said was a disguised test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).South Korean President Park Geun Hye said last week that she was ""deeply saddened"" by the death of Kim.

The GAO report, which was released on Tuesday, found that while the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) have taken steps to improve the nation's cybersecurity posture, they have not done enough. In particular, the report says that DHS and ODNI have been slow to respond to the growing number of cyberthreats that have come to light in recent years, including the recent hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment (NYSE: SNE) that resulted in the release of embarrassing emails and other sensitive information about the company's executives and executives at other companies.
""While the government has made significant progress in improving cybersecurity, it is clear that more needs to be done to ensure that our critical infrastructures are protected,"" said the study's co-author, James Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington, D.C.-based think tank that focuses on national security and foreign policy.

The No. 1-seeded Serb will play the unseeded Gael Monfils of France in Sunday's third-round match at the Flushing Meadows, N.Y., golf course. It will be the second straight year that a top-10 player has made it to the third round of the tournament with wild cards. Last year, Roger Federer did it, as did Rafael Nadal in 2012. ""I don't know what to expect, but I think it's going to be a really good match,"" said the 28-year-old Djoko, who has won three of his last four matches. Djoker said he has no idea what he'll do if he doesn't make it into the fourth round, which would give him a chance to win his first Grand Slam title since he won the French Open in 2011. He's been in this position before, though. In 2011, he lost to Andy Roddick in a three-set semifinal at Roland Garros before winning the title the following year.

A Russian violinist who came out as gay last year has become the first openly gay man to perform in a major Russian orchestra, the state-run TASS news agency reports. The musician, who has not been named, is a member of the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra, which is based in the city of St. Petersburg and is one of Russia's most prestigious orchestras. His performance will be broadcast live on the orchestra's website and on its Facebook page, and it will also be streamed on YouTube and other social media platforms, according to the news service. ""I am proud to be a part of this orchestra,"" the musician said in an interview with the Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, adding that he hopes to inspire other gay musicians to come out, as well as other Russian musicians who may be struggling with their sexuality. He told the newspaper that his coming out was not a political statement, but rather a personal one, saying, ""It was a decision that I had to make for myself. I am not ashamed of it. It is not something I have to hide from anyone."" The news of his performance comes as Russia continues to grapple with a series of high-profile cases of anti-gay violence, including the murder of a gay rights activist in Moscow last month and the brutal beating of two gay men in Volgograd last week. Earlier this month, a Moscow court sentenced two men to three years in prison on charges of ""aggravated homosexuality"" after they were found guilty of having sex outside of marriage.

5157,Aussie military says tracking app doesn't breach security," rulesUpdated
 the Australian Defence Force (ADF) says it has no plans to ban the use of an app that allows users to track the location of military vehicles.
, which is owned by the US-based company Geofeedia, has been downloaded more than 1.5 million times since it was released last year, but the ADF says the app does not breach the Defence Security Service's (DSS) security guidelines.
The DSS is responsible for ensuring the safety and security of Australian military personnel and equipment, and has issued a warning to the company that it is not allowed to use geofencing technology in Australia without the approval of the agency's director general, Brigadier-General Angus Campbell, who is in charge of security at Defence headquarters in Canberra, the ABC has learned. The warning was issued in response to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request made by ABC's Four Corners program. In a statement, a Defence spokesman said the geolocation technology used in the application was not approved for use on Australian soil. ""The application has not been approved to be used by Defence personnel or equipment,"" the statement said, adding that the department had not received any requests for the technology from any other government department or agency. It said it would not be making any further comment on the matter until it had had a chance to review the FOI request. But the spokesman did not rule out the possibility of a ban, saying: ""We will continue to monitor developments in this area and will take any appropriate action as required."" The app uses GPS technology to pinpoint a user's location on a map, allowing them to see exactly where a military vehicle is at any given time. Users can also see the vehicle's speed and direction, as well as its location in relation to other vehicles, buildings, people and other objects. A number of other countries, including the United States, Canada, Britain, France and Germany, have also banned or restricted the usage of such technology. Geolocating technology has become increasingly popular in recent years, with companies such as Google, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook all developing their own versions. Google's Street View cars have been used to map the streets of cities around the world, while Apple's iBeacon technology allows iPhone owners to receive push notifications when their phone is near a particular store or other location. Apple has also been granted a patent for a technology that would allow a device to detect when a person is nearby and",0

The fossils, which were discovered during a construction project at the museum, date back to the Late Pleistocene epoch, a time when humans first appeared in the region, according to a press release from the LACMHNH. [See Photos of the Fossilized Bones and Teeth Found at LA Museum]
""This is the first time we've ever found fossils from this time period, and it's a really exciting discovery,"" said study co-author and paleoanthropologist David Evans, an associate professor of anthropology at UC Santa Cruz. ""It's the earliest evidence of human presence in this part of Southern Califorina, so this is a very important find.""
.. View gallery. The bones were found during the construction of a new museum in downtown L.A., which opened last year. Credit: Courtesy of David E. Evans and the University of California, Santa Barbara.. Image and caption courtesy of UC San Diego. (PhysOrg.com) -- A team of researchers led by a UC Berkeley anthropologist has uncovered the remains of what appears to be a human ancestor in a fossil-rich area of southern California. In a paper published online today in Science, the researchers describe the discovery of fossils that appear to belong to Australopithecus afarensis, or ""hobbit,"" a species of early human that was first discovered in Ethiopia and is now thought to have evolved into Homo erectus in Africa.The fossils were unearthed during an excavation of an area known as the ""Laguna Hills"" near the city of Santa Clarita, about 30 miles south of downtown LA. They were excavated during construction work on a museum that is currently under construction.Evans and his colleagues found the fossils while excavating a section of rock that had been disturbed by construction workers. During the excavation, they discovered the bones of two individuals, one of which was a young adult female. She had a small skull and a large braincase, indicating that she was at least 3.5 feet (1.8 meters) tall, Evans said.She also had teeth that were very similar to those of modern-day humans, he said, adding that the teeth may have been used for grinding food, such as nuts and seeds, rather than for eating meat.""The teeth are very well-preserved,"" Evans told Live Science in an email, ""and we have a good idea of how they were used, as well as what kind of diet they would have had. We don't know much about their diet, but we do know that they probably ate a lot of fruit, nuts, seeds and other plant matter.""In addition to her teeth and skull, researchers also found several other bones, including a femur, ribs, vertebrae, pelvis and lower leg bones. All of these bones are in good condition, with no signs of wear or trauma, said Evans.One bone, however, was particularly interesting, because it was found with a tooth, suggesting that this individual may not have eaten meat at all during her lifetime. It was also the only bone found in such a way that indicated that it had not been eaten by another individual.This finding suggests that humans were able to eat a wide variety of plant and animal foods during their time in South America, perhaps even as early as 2 million to 3 million years before the current age of Homo sapiens,"" the authors wrote in their paper.They added that their findings suggest that early humans in California were likely more diverse than previously thought, possibly because they had access to more plants and animals than had previously been thought.""This discovery is an important step forward in our understanding of our evolutionary history and provides new insights into the early evolution of humans and their interactions with the environment,"" they wrote.",0

Bryant, a Republican, signed the law on Friday, just hours after it was passed by the state's Republican-controlled legislature. The law will take effect in 90 days. It will also require women seeking an abortion to undergo a sonogram and listen to the fetal heartbeat before the procedure, and ban abortions based on the race, sex, disability or genetic information of a fetus, among other restrictions.

 the bill's sponsor, Republican state senator Chris McDaniel, said the measure was necessary to protect the health and safety of women. ""This bill is about protecting the life of every Mississippi woman and her unborn child from the moment of conception until birth,"" he said in a statement. He added: ""I am proud to stand with my fellow Mississippians in signing this bill that will protect women's health, safety and constitutional rights."" The bill was introduced in January and passed the Mississippi House of Representatives earlier this month, but was blocked by a Democratic filibuster.

7913,Group floats down Los Angeles River in inflatable pink flamingo raft,". (Photo: David McNew, Getty Images/iStockphoto)Buy PhotoLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Wednesday that the city will spend $1.5 million to build a floating raft that will be used to rescue people stranded in the river during the upcoming El Niño weather event, which is expected to bring heavy rains and flooding to Southern California and the nation's second-largest metropolitan area this winter season.
Garcetti made the announcement during a press conference at City Hall, where he was joined by Mayor Ed Lee and other city officials to announce the project. The city has already spent $500,000 on the raft, and it will cost about $2 million more to complete the work, according to a statement from the mayor's office. It's unclear how much of that money will go toward the construction of the floating structure, but it's likely to be a significant amount, given the amount of time and money that's already been spent on building the temporary rafts that have been used in recent years to help people get out of flooded areas.
.@ericgarcetti: ""We're going to spend a lot of money on this."" pic.twitter.com/qjz8x8z6zv — David Schaper (@david_schaper) December 6, 2015
 the $3.4 million in funding will come from federal and state grants, as well as private donations and donations from local businesses and organizations, the statement said. ""This is a great example of how we can work together to make a difference in people's lives,"" Lee said at the news conference, adding that he hopes the new raft will serve as a model for other cities to follow.The city is also planning to use the money to hire more people to assist with the rescue efforts, including people who have experience in rescue operations, such as firefighters, police officers, paramedics and lifeguards.Lee said he expects the number of rescues to increase as the weather warms up. He also said that people should be prepared for the possibility that they may not be able to get back to their homes in time to save their loved ones.""We've got to prepare for that possibility,"" he said, ""and we have to do it in a way that doesn't put people in harm's way.""The mayor also noted that there are more than 1 million people living in flood-prone areas across the country, many of whom are not prepared to deal with a major storm like the one that hit the East Coast in late October and early November.",0

The clock tower at the heart of London's financial district will be turned off for the last time on Monday, Dec. 31, at 11:59 p.m. London time. It's the end of an era for one of Britain's most famous landmarks, which has been in use since the 17th century. But it's not the first time the clock has gone silent, and it won't be the only one to do so. In fact, there are more than a dozen clocks in London that are set to turn off in the next few months, according to the BBC. ""It's a very sad day for London,"" London Mayor Sadiq Khan said in a statement. He added that he was ""delighted"" to be able to announce the closure of ""one of our most iconic landmarks."" ""The clock is an iconic part of this city's history,"" he said, ""and I am delighted that it will no longer be used as a source of entertainment for tourists and Londoners alike."" The London Clock Tower is the oldest clock in Britain, dating back to 1660. And it has a history that goes back much further than that. For centuries, the tower has served as the headquarters of a number of British institutions, including the Bank of England and the Royal Society of Arts. Today, it is a popular tourist attraction, with visitors flocking from all over the world to see it in action. According to The Telegraph,",0

The agreement was reached after a meeting between Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski and his Polish counterpart Radoslaw Sikorski in Warsaw on Wednesday. According to the statement, ""the two sides have agreed on the following points: 1) Poland will continue to cooperate with Israel in all areas of mutual interest; 2) the two countries will work together to prevent the spread of anti-Semitism in their respective countries; 3) Israel will provide Poland with the necessary financial and technical assistance in order to carry out its obligations under the agreement."" The statement went on to say that ""both sides agreed to continue their dialogue on issues of common interest, such as the issue of prisoner exchange, as well as on other issues that are of particular interest to both countries."" It was not immediately clear what the terms of this agreement would be, but it is likely that it would include the repatriation of Poles who were captured by Israel during the Six Day War in 1967 and who are still held in Israeli prisons. In addition, Israel is also expected to release the remains of some Polish prisoners who died in captivity. ""We are pleased that we have been able to reach a new agreement that will allow us to move forward in a constructive manner in our cooperation,"" said the foreign minister, who was in Poland to attend a conference on Polish-Israeli relations. He added that he was ""pleased to see that Poland is willing to work with us in this important area of cooperation, which is of great importance for both of our countries and for the entire world."" ""I am confident that this will be the beginning of a long-term and fruitful cooperation between our two nations,"" he said. Poland and Israel have had an uneasy relationship since the end of World War II, when Poland sided with Germany against the Soviet Union. After the fall of communism in 1989, Poland joined the European Union and became a member of NATO. Since then, however, relations between the countries have soured, particularly after Poland's decision to join the EU in 2004 and its decision in 2009 to recognize the state of Israel. Israel has also been criticized for its treatment of Palestinian refugees in its occupied territories. During his visit to Poland, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert also met with President Bronislaw Komorowski and other senior Polish officials.",0

The new, high-resolution, large-format printer is designed to be used in the home, office, or industrial environment, and is the first of its kind to offer the highest resolution of any printer on the market today. It can print up to 1,000 cubic inches of material in a single print, which is more than three times the size of the previous Vision TEC. This new printer will be available in June 2012.

With the new printing technology, users can create objects of virtually any size, shape and color, as well as create complex geometric designs.

In addition to its high quality printing capabilities, this printer also offers a number of other features that make it ideal for home or office use. One of these features is its built-in LCD display that allows users to monitor the progress of their print. Another feature is that it is able to automatically adjust the print speed to match the speed of your computer's printer.

Russia has been stripped of its hosting rights for the Games, which will be held from 5 August to 21 August, after it was found that the law banning ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations to minors"" was ""incompatible with the principles of fundamental human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in [the Olympic] Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights"", the IOC said in a statement on Thursday. The law was passed by the Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, in June, and was signed into law by President Vladimir Putin in July. It bans ""homosexual propaganda"" among minors and imposes fines of up to $10,000 (£6,500) on those found guilty of violating the ban. Russia has also banned the adoption of Russian children by foreign parents, a move that has drawn criticism from the US and other countries. ""The IOC has decided that Russia will not be able to host the 2018 and 2022 Olympic Games,"" the statement said, adding that it would be ""unacceptable"" if Russia was allowed to compete at the Olympics in 2026. Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko said he would appeal against the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne, Switzerland. He said: ""We are ready to take the case to CAS and we will do everything to defend the rights of our compatriots in Russia."" The IOC also said it had decided to suspend the participation of Russia at next year's World Athletics Championships in Moscow, due to concerns about ""the safety and security of athletes and spectators"". The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), which is responsible for monitoring and sanctioning the use of banned substances in sport, said the Russian ban was a ""major blow"" to international sport. Wada director general Olivier Niggli told the BBC that he had been in contact with Russian athletics officials and that they had expressed their ""deepest apologies"" for what had happened. However, he added that ""there is no doubt that this is a major blow to Russian sport"". ""It's a huge blow for Russia, it's an enormous blow,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek programme on Friday morning. In a separate development, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) said that its president, Sebastian Coe, would not attend the IAAF's general assembly in London next week. Coelho, who is also a member of Fifa's executive committee, will instead travel to London to attend a meeting of football's world governing body.",0
3686,For-profit loan forgiveness program could see major cut,"backs under TrumpThe Trump administration is considering a major overhaul of the federal student loan program, according to a new report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. The report, titled ""The Student Loan Forgiveness Program: What's at Stake?"" says that the program has become a ""loophole"" for the wealthy, and that it could face major cuts under President Donald Trump's proposed budget, which is expected to be released later this week.
According to the CFPP's analysis, the Trump budget would reduce the amount of money available to forgive student loans by more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years. It would also eliminate a program that allows borrowers to refinance their loans at a lower interest rate, as well as a tax credit that helps low- and middle-income students pay for college. In addition, it would eliminate the income-based repayment plan that borrowers can take advantage of to reduce their monthly payments by as much as $10,000 over a 10-year period.

The court said that in this case, it was not possible to prove that Ion was guilty because he had not been charged with a crime.

7888,Girl dies after shooting over video game controller,"A man is dead and a woman is in critical condition after a shooting at an apartment complex on the Northwest Side, according to police and the Cook County medical examiner's office. The woman was shot in the head and pronounced dead at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, authorities said. She was identified by family members as 23-year-old Tanisha Anderson, of the 5200 block of North Kedzie Avenue in Chicago. A man in his 20s was taken to Stroger Hospital in serious condition with a gunshot wound to the chest, police said, and he was listed in good condition Friday night. No one else was in custody in connection with the shooting, which happened about 11:30 p.m. Friday at the apartment building at 5100 N. Kildare Ave., police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said at a news conference. Anderson's body was found in a stairwell of a second-floor apartment, where she had been shot multiple times, he added. ""It appears to be a random act of violence,"" he told reporters. Police did not release the names of those involved, but said they were not related to each other and that no one was believed to have been involved in any gang activity. Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said the man who was killed was not a gang member and had no known gang affiliations. He added that the woman had a history of mental illness and was a victim of domestic violence. McCarthy also said there was no evidence to suggest that anyone was trying to rob Anderson or that she was the intended target. But he said it was too early to say whether the incident was gang-related or whether it had anything to do with video games. In a statement, the family of Anderson said: ""We are deeply saddened by the loss of our beloved daughter, daughter-in-law, sister, niece, auntie, cousin and friend. We ask that you respect our privacy during this very difficult time."" The family also asked for prayers for the victim's family and for those who may have witnessed or been in contact with her during the time of her death. They also thanked the community for its support and said that they would be holding a memorial service for Anderson on Saturday at 11 a. m. at St. Mary's Catholic Church, 7200 W. Irving Park Road, Chicago, Ill. About 100 people attended the service, said parishioners, who declined to give their names because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the case. According to a family member, Anderson had recently moved to Chicago from the Chicago suburb of Evanston, a suburb about 30 miles north of Chicago where her father is a pastor. Family members said Anderson was an avid gamer who loved to play games such as ""Call of Duty"" and ""Grand Theft Auto."" ""She was just a sweet girl,"" said her mother, Michelle Anderson. Her father said he had not heard from his daughter since she left for Chicago about a month ago. His daughter had just started a new job as an administrative assistant at Northwestern University's medical school, his son said Friday, adding that his mother had told him that Anderson would not be coming home for a while because she needed to take care of some family matters. On her Facebook page, she posted a photo of herself and her two young children, one of whom was wearing a T-shirt that read, ""I love you, mommy."" She also posted an image of what she said was her daughter's favorite game, an action-adventure game called ""The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,"" which she described as a ""love letter to my little girl."" On the game's official website, it says that it is ""a game of exploration, puzzle-solving and sword-swinging."" It is available for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, iOS, Android and Xbox 360. It was released in 2001 and has sold more than 2.5 million copies worldwide, Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime said in an e-mailed statement to The Associated Press on Friday. Nintendo has not released any information about what happened to Anderson since her departure from Chicago on Jan. 31, when she told her parents she wanted to move back to her hometown, her brother told The Chicago Sun-Times. After her family reported her missing, they received a call from a friend who had seen her on a Chicago-area television news program. That friend told the Anderson family that a man had shot and killed Anderson and then fled the scene, leaving her body in her apartment. Authorities have not said whether they believe the killing was random or if there were any ties between the shooter and any known gangs or gangs affiliated with gangs, McCarthy told a press conference Friday afternoon. Investigators are looking at surveillance video from nearby businesses to try to determine if anyone saw anything that might help them in their investigation,",0

2790,Cubans now face same deportation risk as other immigrants," in U.S.The Obama administration's decision to allow Cubans to remain in the United States is a major victory for the Cuban-American community, which has been fighting for years to have the island removed from the list of countries designated by the State Department as state sponsors of terrorism.
Cuban President Raul Castro speaks during a news conference at the Miraflores presidential palace in Havana, Cuba, on Tuesday. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) (Photo: Pablo Martinez, AP) Story Highlights Cuba is now a state sponsor of terror, the same as Iran, Syria and North Korea. It is the only country on the terror list that is not a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or the Organization of American States (OAS). Cuba has also been designated as a ""state sponsor"" of international terrorism by a number of other countries, including the European Union, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Norway and Switzerland. The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution in December 2012 calling on Cuba to end its support for terrorism and its human rights abuses, and to release political prisoners and other prisoners of conscience. President Obama has said he will veto the resolution if it comes to a vote in Congress, but he has not said whether he would veto a veto of a similar resolution by Congress if he were to be re-elected in 2016. Cuba's government has repeatedly denied that it supports terrorism, saying it is committed to democracy and the rule of law. However, in recent years, Cuban officials have been accused of supporting terrorist groups such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the Marxist-Leninist Party of Cuba (PCC) and FARC-EP, as well as terrorist organizations in Latin America, Africa and Asia. In 2012, a Cuban diplomat was sentenced to 15 years in prison for his role in a plot to assassinate Cuban President Raúl Castro, who is also the brother of Fidel Castro. He was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced in absentia to five years of house arrest and a $10,000 fine, according to the Miami Herald. A Cuban government official told the Associated Press in 2012 that the government was not involved in any plots to kill Castro and that there was no evidence to support the claim. ""We have never supported terrorism,"" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the case. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Torres said in an interview with the AP last year that his government ""does not support terrorism."" ""It's not true that we support terrorists,"" he said, adding that Cuba was ""not a country that supports terrorists."" In a statement released Tuesday, Obama called the decision ""a significant step forward in our efforts to normalize relations between our two countries."" He said it would ""strengthen our ties with our Cuban brothers and sisters and strengthen our security and our economic ties."" Obama also said that he is ""committed to continuing to work with Congress to pass legislation that will allow us to lift the travel and trade restrictions that are currently in place on Cuban individuals and entities."" The announcement comes as Obama prepares to travel to Cuba next week for a summit with Castro at which the two leaders are expected to discuss a range of issues, from economic cooperation to human-rights issues. Obama will be the first sitting American president to visit Cuba since Calvin Coolidge in 1928, when he was in office from 1928-1933. During the Cold War, Castro was a close ally of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. After the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, he became a strong supporter of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, whom he had supported during the Iran-Iraq War. Castro's brother, Fidel, died in November at age 90, after a long battle with cancer. His death was announced by his brother's office in Cuba.

The vandalism was discovered on Saturday morning by a woman who was walking her dog near the park, the newspaper reported. The statue, which depicts a young boy in a baseball uniform, was covered in black spray paint and had the word ""White Power"" written on it in white paint, along with the letters ""KKK,"" the Nazi symbol for the ""Knights of the Ku Klux Klan."" The words were also spray-painted on the statue's left arm. A baseball bat was also found nearby, and police are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime, police spokeswoman Schron Jackson said in an email to The Associated Press. Jackson did not immediately respond to an AP request for more information about the case.

, who is black, told the AP that she was shocked and saddened by the vandalism. ""It's a symbol of our history and our heritage,"" she said, adding that it was ""very hurtful"" to see the symbol used in such a way. She said she and her husband, a white man, have visited the town several times over the years and have never seen anything like this happen before. It's not the first time in recent months that the city has had to deal with hate-related incidents. Last month, an African-American man was fatally shot by police after he allegedly pointed a gun at officers during a traffic stop. Police have not said whether the shooting was related to the recent vandalism, but the man's family has said he was not armed and that he had a permit to carry a concealed weapon. Earlier this year, white supremacist Dylann Roof was sentenced to death for killing nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. He was convicted of hate crimes and obstruction of religion, among other charges, after a racially motivated rampage that left nine people dead at the historically black Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Roof's sentencing was delayed after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of his death sentence. In June, two men were",0

A woman who breastfed her two-year-old daughter for more than a year after she was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer has been overwhelmed by the generosity of strangers.The mother, who has not been named, was told by doctors that she would not be able to breastfeed her daughter any longer and had to give up her job to care for her sick daughter. She was also told that the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes and brain, leaving her unable to feed her child. But the mother was determined to continue her fight against the disease and decided to take matters into her own hands by breastfeeding her little girl for the last two years of her life. The mother said: 'I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I started breastfeeding my daughter, but I knew I wanted to do it. I didn't want her to grow up without a mother. 'It was a very difficult decision for me to make, and I'm so grateful to all the people who have supported me through it all. It's given me the strength to keep going.' The woman said she had been given the all-clear from her doctors after a series of tests revealed that her cancer was in remission and that there was no sign of it returning....

2245,"Democrats propose new income tax bracket for those making more than $125,000 a year","WASHINGTON (AP) — The top tax rate on income over $1 million for the first time will rise to 39.6 percent, up from 35 percent under current law, the White House said Thursday. The new rate will apply to income from all sources, including capital gains, dividends and interest. It will be the highest top rate since President Barack Obama took office in January 2009, when it was 38.5 percent. Obama has said he wants to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans to help pay for his health care law. ""This is the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States,"" Obama said at a news conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron in London. He said the new tax would raise $2.4 trillion over the next decade, which he said would be paid for by closing tax loopholes and simplifying the tax code. But he also said it would not be revenue-neutral, meaning it wouldn't raise as much revenue as the Bush-era tax cuts that were enacted under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003. In addition to raising taxes, Obama's plan would reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three and eliminate the alternative minimum tax, a tax on high-income earners that has been in place since the early 1980s. His plan also would increase the standard deduction for individuals and families to $12,500 from $6,350, and the child tax credit for families with children would rise by $500. Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, have said they will not support the president's tax plan, saying it will add to the nation's debt and hurt the middle class. They have also criticized Obama for not proposing a plan to close the so-called ""carried interest"" loophole that allows hedge fund managers to pay lower tax rates than their secretaries and other lower-paid workers.
The president also announced a new proposal to make college more affordable for middle-class families. Under his proposal, families earning up to four times the federal poverty level — about $48,600 for a family of four — would pay no more in tuition at public colleges and universities than they do now. That's an increase from the current rate of $5,550 for four-year public institutions and $3,850 for community colleges, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, an independent research group in Washington, D.C., that advocates for lower taxes and smaller government.",0

""I'm just trying to make a living."" Another said, ""It's just a job. I can't do anything else."" A third said she was ""just doing it for the money."" And a fourth said he had ""no idea"" what he was doing. All of these people, it turned out, had been working for months or even years at the same job, but had no clue what it entailed or how to get out of it. They didn't even know how much money they made, let alone how they could afford to pay it back. It was as if they had never even heard of a bank account, much less a credit card or a checking account. And they certainly hadn't heard about credit cards, mortgages, or student loans. In fact, most of them were unaware that there was even such a thing as a ""credit card"" or ""mortgage"" in the first place. The only thing they knew for sure was that they couldn't pay their bills or pay off their debts without the help of someone else, someone who was willing to lend them money to do so. This is the story of how I came to learn about the world's most popular form of consumer debt, the ""debt snowball,"" and how it has changed the lives of millions of people around the globe.
The Debt Snowball the debt snowball is a term used to describe the process by which people borrow money from one another in order to buy goods and services, such as cars, houses, vacations, etc. These debts are often referred to as ""loans to own"" (LOTs) because they are owed to someone other than the person who actually owns the goods or services in question. For example, if you buy a car from a dealership, you may owe the dealership money for a loan to purchase the car. If you borrow $1,000 from your parents, they may lend you $500 to help pay for your car, which you then pay back with interest every month. You may also have a mortgage on your home that you owe to a third party, who in turn owes you money in exchange for letting you live in their home. As you can see,",0

3226,Worst-hit reactor at Fukushima may be easiest to clean up,", experts sayThe Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has been crippled by the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan on March 11, 2011. (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) Story Highlights The worst-affected reactor is the No. 1 reactor, which was damaged in the quake and subsequent tsunami. It was shut down in March 2011, but restarted in April 2012. The plant is located in Fukushima Prefecture, about 200 miles north of Tokyo.
More than 100,000 people have been evacuated from the area around the plant, and more than 1,500 people are still living in temporary housing. About 2,300 people remain in a temporary evacuation center in Iwaki, a town about 100 miles south of the nuclear plant. More than 200 people live in an evacuation shelter in Sendai, Japan's second-largest city, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has said it is working with the Japanese government to determine the best way to remove the contaminated water and soil from Fukushima's damaged reactors. But the NRC has not said how long the cleanup will take, or how much it will cost. ""It's going to take a long time to get rid of all the radioactive material,"" said David Lochbaum, an expert on nuclear safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, D.C., who has studied the Fukushima plant since it was hit by a tsunami in 2011 and is now working on a book about the disaster. Lochbaum said he expects the worst to be over in about a year and a half, if not sooner. However, he added, ""I don't think we'll ever be able to say for sure what the long-term health effects will be."" ""There's a lot of uncertainty about what will happen,"" he said, adding that ""there's no way of knowing"" how many people will die as a result of radiation exposure. In March 2012, the JMA reported that the number of evacuees living outside the evacuation zone had risen to about 1.5 million, up from about 500,00 in February 2012 and about 400,0000 in January 2011 when the tsunami hit.

7918,Fatal Vallejo shooting may be related to fight between two elementary school students," Copyright by KRON - All rights reserved VideoSAN FRANCISCO (KRON) -- A fatal shooting at a San Francisco school may have been the result of a fight, according to the Contra Costa County District Attorney's Office.
The district attorney's office is investigating the shooting death of 14-year-old Kody Brown, who was shot in the head and killed by a school resource officer on Tuesday morning. The officer was responding to a report of shots fired in a hallway at the San Jose Unified School District, where Brown was a student, when he was confronted by two students, one of whom was armed with a gun, the district said. Brown and the other student exchanged words, and then the student with the gun pulled out a handgun and shot Brown multiple times, killing him, officials said Wednesday. No weapon was recovered from the scene, but investigators are looking into the possibility that it was the same weapon used in another fatal school shooting earlier this year in San Mateo County. In that case, a 14 year old boy was fatally shot by an off-duty sheriff's deputy after an argument over a girl. That shooting was also ruled a suicide.",0

2450,27-yr-old arrested for extorting millions from old man,"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2909741/Man-arrested-extorting-millions-Old-Man.html
A man has been arrested on suspicion of extortion after he allegedly demanded money from an elderly man who was living in a nursing home. The man, who is believed to be in his 70s, is said to have threatened to kill the man if he did not hand over the money. He was arrested at his home in the city of Krasnoyarsk, north-east of Moscow, and is being held in custody pending further investigation, a spokesman for the Investigative Committee, Vladimir Markin, was quoted as saying by the RIA Novosti news agency. ""We are investigating the case,"" he said, adding that the suspect had not yet been formally charged with a crime.
...
""The man is a pensioner who lives in an old people's home,"" the spokesman said. It was not immediately clear how much money he had demanded, but it was likely to amount to hundreds of thousands of roubles, he added. A police spokesman declined to comment on the nature of the alleged extortion, saying only that it had been reported to the police and that an investigation was under way. In a separate incident, police said they had arrested a man in connection with an incident in which a woman was allegedly threatened with rape and murder if she refused to pay a sum of money to her ex-boyfriend. According to a police statement, the woman, identified only by her first name, Olga, told police that she had received a phone call from her former boyfriend, named only as Alexander, threatening to rape her and kill her unless she paid him $1,000 (£600) within 24 hours. She said she agreed to meet him at a hotel in Moscow but was unable to find him. When she arrived at the hotel, however, she found Alexander waiting for her, holding a knife and telling her that he was going to cut off her head and put it on a platter, according to police. After the meeting, Alexander allegedly told her: ""If you don't pay me now, I will kill you."" The woman then called police to report the incident. Police arrested Alexander and took him into custody. They are now investigating whether he committed any other crimes, said the statement.",0

I don't think I've ever had an egg that didn't come out perfect, and that's saying a lot. The second thing I liked about this recipe is that you can make it ahead of time and freeze it. So if you're looking for a quick and easy egg dish, this is the one for you.

The Senate is expected to vote on the House-passed bill on Thursday, and the two chambers will have to reconcile their differences before a government funding bill can be sent to President Obama's desk for his signature. The Senate passed its version of the spending bill last week, which included $1.1 trillion in new spending over the next 10 years. But House Republicans, who control the chamber, have balked at the bill's spending levels, saying they don't go far enough to reduce the nation's $16.7 trillion debt. House GOP leaders have said they will try to pass their own bill in the coming days, though it's unclear whether they'll be able to get it through the Democratic-controlled Senate, where Democrats have vowed to block any bill that doesn't cut spending by at least $60 billion.

The U.S. government will run out of money to pay its bills by the end of this month unless Congress acts to raise the federal borrowing limit, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The CBO said Thursday that if the debt limit isn't raised by Sept. 29, the Treasury Department will exhaust its ability to borrow money and will be forced to default on some of its obligations, including interest payments on its debt and Social Security benefits for retired workers. ""If we do not act soon, we will not have sufficient borrowing authority to meet all of our current obligations,"" CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf said in a statement. If Congress fails to act by then, ""the United States would enter a period of time during which it would not be possible to make all the payments that it has already made under the law and that are due on that date,"" he said.

The Heat have the second-best net rating (plus-4.1) in NBA play, and the Heat are the only team to rank among the top-10 in both offensive and defensive efficiency. Miami's bench is averaging a league-leading plus-7.3 points per 100 possessions, which is second only to the Golden State Warriors' bench at +8.2 points. In fact, the Miami bench ranks third in offensive efficiency, behind only the Warriors and San Antonio Spurs, per NBA.com's stats page. It's not just the starters that have been a big part of the team's success, though, as Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Luol Deng, Josh McRoberts and Udonis Haslem are all averaging double-doubles on a per-game basis. Wade has scored at least 20 points in each of his last four games, while Bosh has hit double figures in four straight games and McDonough has reached double digits in five straight contests. With the way Miami is playing right now, there's no reason to think it won't continue to play that way for the foreseeable future.",0

Posted Mar 09 2013 12:00AM CLEVELAND (AP) LeBron James scored 37 points, Kyrie Irving added a career-high 36 points and the Cleveland Cavaliers held off a late rally by the Indiana Pacers to snap a three-game losing streak in the series. James and Irving each scored 17 points in a third-quarter surge that helped the Cavaliers hold off the Pacers 116-110 on Wednesday night. ""We just kept fighting,"" said James, who had 24 points on 9-of-13 shooting. The Cavaliers (37-26) have won three straight and six of seven. They have a chance to win the Eastern Conference finals for the second time in three years. Indiana (33-33) has lost four of five and is in danger of missing the playoffs for a second straight season. Paul George scored 20 points for Indiana, which has dropped five of six. Lance Stephenson added 16 points. David West scored 14 and George Hill had 13 points to lead Indiana. C.J. Miles scored 12 for Cleveland, and Tristan Thompson added 11. Irving, the NBA's leading scorer, had a season-best 34 points against Indiana last month. He has scored at least 30 in each of his last three games. Cleveland has won four straight in this series and seven of eight overall. It's the first time the teams have met since the 2011-12 season, when Indiana beat Cleveland in Game 6 of the conference finals at Quicken Loans Arena. That was the last time Indiana won a playoff series in Cleveland. After the game, Pacers coach Frank Vogel said he didn't know if he would be able to get his team ready for Game 7 on Friday night at home against the Los Angeles Lakers. Pacers center Roy Hibbert missed his third straight game with a sprained left ankle, but he returned to the starting lineup and finished with 12 points - including a pair of 3-pointers - and eight rebounds. George led Indiana with 22 points but was held to 10 points after missing two of three shots and finishing with six points during a 10-0 run midway through the third quarter that cut the Cavs' lead to 95-93. But Irving scored the final eight points of a 13-2 run that put the Celtics up by four points at the break. NOTES: The Pacers are 0-3 on the road this season and have lost three of their last four.... The Cavs were without center Anderson Varejao (left ankle sprain) and forward David Lee (sprained right ankle).... Indiana was without starting center Ian Mahinmi (knee), who was listed as day-to-day. --- Follow Brian Mahoney on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Briancmahoney

The case was filed on behalf of a group of imams, lawyers, and religious scholars who argued that the DHS and FAA had violated their First Amendment rights to free speech and freedom of religion by refusing to remove the group from the TSC's list of ""known or suspected"" terrorist organizations. In a 2-1 decision, the court dismissed the case on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to support the plaintiffs' claim that DHS or the FAA acted with ""deliberate indifference"" to the religious beliefs of their clients, or that they acted in a manner that was ""arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise violative of the Establishment Clause."" The court also held that ""there is no evidence in the record to show that [the plaintiffs] have suffered any actual or threatened injury"" from DHS's and/or FAA's actions.
""The court's decision to dismiss this case is a victory for religious freedom and a rebuke to those who would use the threat of terrorism as an excuse to discriminate against religious groups,"" said Aifd Executive Director Hina Shamsi.

.@KyrieIrving is back in the lineup tonight. pic.twitter.com/qjZ8qX6QJl — Cleveland Cavs (@Cavs) November 29, 2017
 the Cavs have been without Irving for 21 straight games, the longest such absence in NBA history. Irving has missed the last two games with an ankle injury, but he was back on the floor for Wednesday's game against the Raptors at Quicken Loans Arena. He scored a season-high 28 points on 10-of-14 shooting, including 5-for-6 from 3-point range, to go along with six assists and four rebounds. ""I'm just happy to be back out there,"" Irving said following the game. The Cavaliers have won five of their last six games and sit in a tie for first place in their Eastern Conference playoff race with the Boston Celtics. Cleveland has won six of its last seven games against Toronto, with Irving scoring a team-best 27 points in that span. Toronto is coming off a 102-99 loss at the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday night. DeMar DeRozan scored 24 points and Jonas Valanciunas added 20 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists in his return from a sprained left ankle. Kyle Lowry added 18 points for Toronto (13-22), which has lost four of five. Lowry has averaged 22.0 points over his last five games. His last game back was Nov. 21 against Atlanta, when he scored 22 points with eight assists, six rebounds, three steals and one block in 33 minutes. That was his first game since Nov, 23, 2016, in which he went scoreless in 22 minutes in Toronto's win over New Orleans. Raptors coach Dwane Casey said Lowry will be a game-time decision for Thursday night's home matchup with Boston. Casey also said he expects to see DeMarcus Cousins (sprained right ankle) and DeAndre Jordan (knee) in Thursday's contest. Cousins is listed as questionable, while Jordan is day-to-day, according to Casey.",0

The meeting was the first between the two leaders since the signing of a reconciliation agreement between Fatah and Hamas in April, which led to the formation of the unity government headed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Netanyahu's office said the meeting focused on ""the importance of reaching a final status agreement that is acceptable to both sides."" The statement added that the Israeli prime minister reiterated his commitment to a two-state solution, and that he would continue to work to achieve a peace agreement with the Palestinians. It did not elaborate on the topics discussed during the talks. In a separate statement released by the PA, Abbas said he and Netanyahu had agreed to continue working toward the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, with East Jerusalem as its capital. He also called for the release of all Palestinian prisoners, who have been held without charge or trial in Israeli jails since before the Oslo Accords were signed in 1993. ""We have agreed that we will continue our efforts to reach a comprehensive and just agreement,"" the statement said, without elaborating on what those efforts would entail. Palestinian officials have previously said that they would be willing to return to negotiations with Israel without preconditions, but only if Israel agrees to release all of its prisoners.

In fact, since 2000, only three teams have had a winning record in each of their first three seasons, and only one of those teams has gone on to win the Super Bowl in that span: the 2000 Ravens, who went 10-6 and won the AFC Championship Game before losing to Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. The other two teams, the 2004 Patriots and 2011 Broncos, went 9-7-1 and lost the divisional round of the playoffs, respectively.

2830,"Turnovers, big plays give Springville first win"," of seasonSpringville, Utah – The Utah State Aggies (1-0) defeated the Utah Valley Wolverines (0-1) by a score of 31-24 in the first game of the season. The game was played in front of a sellout crowd of 4,000 fans at the University of Utah.
Utah State opened the game with a 10-play, 80-yard drive that ended in a field goal. After the drive ended, the Aggie offense went three-and-out on its next possession, but the defense came up with the big play on the next play to force a three and out. On the ensuing drive, a punt was returned for a touchdown, and a two-point conversion was made to make the score 21-7. A punt return touchdown was followed by an interception, which was recovered by the Utes, giving them the ball at their own 20. From there, it was just a matter of time before the offense took over and the team went on to score touchdowns on four of their next five possessions to take a 28-14 lead into the locker room at halftime. It was the second time this season that a team has scored at least 28 points in each of its first two games. In fact, no team in FBS history has ever scored more than 28 in two consecutive games, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Utah has now scored 28 or more points three times in its last four games and is on pace to break the school record for most points scored in an eight-game span, set by Texas A&M in 2012-13, when it scored a school-record 48 points.

The Bush family is returning to Washington after a two-week vacation in Maine. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, Pool) less Bush spokesman Jim McGrath says the former president is ""eager to get well, go to Maine"" and that ""he's looking forward to spending time with his family and friends."" Bush... more Photo: Pablo Martinez-Muneo, Associated Press Bush spokesmen George W. and Laura Bush are expected to visit Maine on Friday, according to a spokesman for the president's office. They will be joined by their daughters, Barbara and Jenna, and their sons, Jeb and Jeb Jr., who are attending the University of Maine at Presque Isle. In a statement, the spokesman said: ""The President and the First Lady are excited to be back in the state and to spend some quality time together with their friends and family."" The spokesman did not say when the visit would take place or whether it would be on the same day as the family's trip to New Hampshire. Earlier this week, Bush was hospitalized after suffering a heart attack while vacationing at his ranch in Kennebunkport, N.H. He was treated and released from the hospital on Wednesday. His condition was upgraded to ""fair"" Wednesday and he is now in ""good spirits,"" his office said. ""He is in good spirits, he's doing well,"" said his daughter Barbara Bush, who was with her father when he went into cardiac arrest. She added that she and her husband, former Florida governor Jeb, were ""overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support"" from people around the world, including in New York City, where she was attending a book signing for her new book, ""Wedding Crashers."" ""We are so grateful for all of the prayers and well wishes that have been sent our way,"" she said in a written statement. A spokeswoman for President Obama said he was ""deeply saddened"" to learn of Bush's illness and ""hopes that he will make a full and speedy recovery."" She said Obama had spoken to Bush by phone and offered his ""sincerest thoughts and prayers"" for his recovery and recovery of his health. On Wednesday night, Obama tweeted that Bush had been ""a great president and a great friend to the American people."" He said Bush ""will be missed by so many, but especially by those who knew him best."" On Thursday morning, as Bush prepared to leave Washington for Maine, a group of about a dozen people gathered outside his home to pay their respects. Among them was a woman who said she had known Bush for more than 20 years and described him as a ""gentle giant"" who had ""always been there for me and my family"" when she needed him most. Another woman said that while she didn't know Bush personally, she admired him because he had always been willing to help others, even if it meant going against the advice of some in his own party. And a man who identified himself only as ""John"" told the crowd that it was important for people to remember Bush as someone who ""took a stand for what he believed in and stood up to what was wrong with our country."" As Bush left the house, his motorcade was surrounded by a throng of reporters, photographers and photographers' assistants, many of whom were waiting for him to make his way to his car. At one point, one of them asked Bush if he would like to take a picture with them, to which he replied, with a smile, that if they wanted to, they were welcome to do so. As he drove away, another reporter asked him what his favorite memory from his time in office was and Bush replied that the one he remembered the most was the first time he met with the families of victims of Sept. 11, 2001, at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. It was there, after the plane had hit the World Trade Center towers and crashed into the Pentagon, in front of a crowd of thousands of people that had gathered to honor the victims and express their gratitude to him for saving the lives of many Americans. After the ceremony, which included a moment of silence in memory of those killed on 9/11 and then a standing ovation for Bush from those in attendance, it seemed as though he might be headed home. But then he stopped, turned around and waved to those gathered, saying ""thank you"" as they cheered and clapped. Then he turned back and drove",0

It's also a great read for those who want to learn more about the history of warfare in the ancient world.
2. War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy. One of my all-time favorite books, this is one of those books that you can't put down once you've finished reading it. If you're a history buff, you'll love this book as much as I do. You can read it in one sitting, or read the whole thing in a day or two, depending on how much time you have to spare. I recommend reading the first part first, as it's the most important part, but if you don't have time to read all the way through the entire book, I'd recommend starting with the second part and then moving on to the third and fourth parts as you get to know the characters and the world better.

The Giants have been outscored by an average of more than 20 points per game this season, which is the second-worst mark in NFL history for a team that started the season 0-2.

The book, which will be published by Simon & Schuster in the US and by Penguin Random House in Britain, is based on Turner's own experiences as a child growing up on the east coast of America, where her father was an alcoholic and her mother was a drug addict. She said that she wanted to tell the story of a generation of young people who had been raised in a culture in which drugs and alcohol were seen as normal parts of life, but who were now struggling to deal with the consequences of their own choices. The book will also include stories from the lives of other celebrities who have been affected by substance abuse, such as the comedian Louis C.K. and the singer-songwriter Miley Cyrus.

 the NBA's leading scorer, Paul George, scored a season-high 32 points and grabbed 11 rebounds as the Indiana Pacers beat the Memphis Grizzlies for their third straight victory, 105 to 101, on Wednesday night. ""It was a great win for us,"" George told the team's official website after the game. The Pacers, who have won five of six, improved to 2-0 on a five-game homestand. Indiana led by as many as 19 points in the first half, but the Grizzlies rallied to take a one-point lead into the locker room at halftime. Memphis, which has lost three of its last four games, had a chance to tie or take the lead before George hit a 3-pointer with 1:18 left in regulation to give the Pacers a 100-99 lead. George then hit two free throws to put Indiana ahead for good at 101-100 with 2:30 left. He finished with a game-best 32. Paul Millsap led the way for the Grizz, scoring a team-leading 21 points. Mike Conley added 16 points, while Marc Gasol had 13 points on 5-of-11 shooting. Zach Randolph had 12 points for Memphis. It was Memphis' first loss in three games since losing to the Los Angeles Clippers on Feb. 19. Randolph, the league's leader in rebounding, was held to six points by George and was the only Memphis player to score in double figures. Grizzlies coach Dave Joerger said he was pleased with how his team responded after falling behind so quickly against a Pacers team that was playing its second game in four nights. ""(The Pacers) are a very good team, and we knew they were going to come out and play hard,"" he said, ""and that's exactly what they did."" The Grizzlies have lost four of their last five games and are 1-6 on the road this season. They haven't won at home since beating the New York Knicks on Jan. 31. NOTES: The game was played at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, home of Indiana University's men's basketball team.... Grizzlies G Tony Allen missed his second straight game because of a sprained left ankle.

1804,McDonald's reaches settlement in 'joint-employer' lawsuit,"A McDonald's franchisee has reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Labor in a class-action lawsuit alleging that the fast-food chain violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) by paying its franchisees less than the federal minimum wage and overtime pay. The settlement was announced today by the Department's Wage and Hour Division, which is responsible for enforcing the FLSA, and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which enforces the NLRA. Under the terms of the settlement, the company will pay $1.5 million to the plaintiffs and $500,000 in attorneys' fees and costs, as well as an additional $2.2 million in back wages and benefits to franchise employees.
The settlement resolves a complaint filed in the District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of more than 1,500 franchise workers who worked at McDonalds restaurants in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Westchester County, N.Y., between January 1 and December 31, 2012. In the complaint, plaintiffs alleged that McDonald�s failed to pay them at least the federally mandated minimum hourly wage of $7.25 per hour for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week. Plaintiffs also claimed that they were not paid overtime for any time worked over 40, nor were they paid for time spent off the clock, such as vacation, sick leave, or personal time off. They also alleged violations of their right to form a union and to collectively bargain for better wages, hours and working conditions, among other things. As a result of these allegations, they sought to represent themselves in court and sought injunctive relief to prevent the defendants from continuing to violate their rights to organize and bargain collectively. After a three-week trial, a jury found for plaintiffs on all counts and awarded them $3.3 million. McDonald´s appealed the jury's verdict, arguing that it was not entitled to summary judgment on the merits because it did not meet its burden of showing that plaintiffs had standing to bring the case. On appeal, however, we reversed the district court� decision and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We now affirm the trial court's order granting plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction and for an award of attorneys� fees, costs and expenses.",0

279,Rays OF Carlos Gomez says players targeted for drug testing," should be allowed to play in games. (Photo: Mark J. Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports)SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Players who test positive for performance-enhancing drugs should not be banned from playing in the major leagues, Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Tuesday.
 the Associated Press reported that MLB is considering a rule change that would allow players to be suspended for up to a year if they are found to have a banned substance in their system. The rule would apply to all players, not just those who have tested positive, the AP reported, citing a person with knowledge of the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. MLB has not yet made a final decision on the rule, which could be announced as early as Wednesday, according to ESPN.com's Jerry Crasnick, who first reported the news. A spokesman for the commissioner's office declined to comment on Tuesday's report, saying the league is still reviewing the issue and will make a decision ""as soon as possible."" The person said the change would not apply retroactively to players who were suspended prior to Jan. 1, 2014, when the new drug-testing policy went into effect. ""I think it's fair to say that if a player has a positive test, he shouldn't be playing,"" MLB executive vice president of labor relations Joe Torre said in a conference call with reporters on Monday, adding that ""there's no question that there are players out there who are using performance enhancing drugs."" ""We're going to do everything we can to make sure that those players are not playing, and that's what we're doing,"" he said. In a statement released Tuesday, MLB said it is ""committed to protecting the health and safety of our players"" and ""will continue to work closely with the MLB Players Association to address this issue."" MLBPA executive director Tony Clark said he has ""no doubt"" the union will work with MLB to ""ensure that the players' interests are protected in this matter."" In the statement, Clark called the proposed rule ""an important step forward in our efforts to reduce the use of banned substances in baseball."" He added: ""It is important to note, however, that this is not the first time that we have taken this step. We have already taken steps to ensure the safety and well-being of baseball players and their families. This is just one of many steps we are taking to protect players from the risks associated with using prohibited substances, including the introduction of a new, more stringent testing program for all major league players beginning in 2014."" A player who tests positive would be subject to suspension for a minimum of one year and a maximum of two years, with an additional two-year suspension possible if the player had previously been suspended under the old policy. Players would also be required to undergo a drug and alcohol evaluation, undergo random drug tests and participate in drug education and treatment programs. Under the current policy, suspensions for positive tests are determined by a panel of three independent arbitrators. If the panel determines that a suspension is warranted, it can be appealed to an independent arbitration panel. That panel can overturn the suspension and impose a lesser penalty, such as a fine, suspension or a lifetime ban from all baseball-related activities.",0

 the agency said the couple were convicted of ""spying against national security"" and ""collaborating with hostile powers."" It did not give details of the charges against them, but said they were arrested in January 2016. The report was carried by the semi-official Fars news agency, which is affiliated with the hard-line Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. It was not immediately possible to verify the report, and it could not be independently confirmed by The Associated Press. Iran's judiciary is controlled by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say on all state matters. He has not commented on the case since it was first reported last year. In a separate case, an Iranian-American businessman has been sentenced to death in absentia by a Tehran court for spying, according to the judiciary's official news website, Mizan Online. That sentence was handed down last month, it said, without giving details. Both cases have been widely reported in the Iranian media, though the details have not been made public. They are the latest in a series of high-profile arrests of Americans in recent years, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, both of whom were held for more than a year on espionage charges before being released on bail in 2015. A third American, former Marine Amir Hekmati, was sentenced in 2016 to 15 years for espionage and other charges after he was arrested while visiting family in Iran in 2012. His case is still pending.",0

2893,The day before the war? North Korea calls off ambassadors," from South Korea, Japan and the U.S.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is seen in this undated photo released by Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), in Pyongyang on April 15, 2017. (Photo: KCNA, via AFP/Getty Images) Story Highlights North Korean state media says Kim has ordered the country's military to prepare to launch a preemptive strike against the United States and its allies in the event of war on the Korean Peninsula, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Saturday. The statement was made in response to a question from a reporter on whether Kim had ordered his troops to carry out a pre-emptive nuclear strike on South Korean targets. ""The supreme commander of our armed forces has decided to make preparations for the counter-measure to be carried out in case of a war,"" the statement said, referring to Kim by his official title of ""supreme commander"" or ""commander-in-chief."" ""We will make all-out efforts to strike back mercilessly at the enemy's strongholds,"" it added, without elaborating on what those targets might be. It was the first time the North had made such a statement since Kim took over as leader in late 2011 after the death of his father and grandfather, Kim Il Sung, who had ruled the isolated country for more than half a century. Kim is believed to have taken over after his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, was executed by firing squad on Dec. 17, 2011, in what was widely seen as a show of power by the young leader. North Koreans watch a news program broadcast on a big screen at Pyongyang's Mangyongdae Children's Palace on March 9, 2013. A North-South Korean border war could break out at any time, experts say, with the two Koreas technically still at war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, and a 1953 armistice that ended the fighting.

 the statement said that the operation was launched on Saturday, and that Iraqi forces were able to liberate the villages of Al-Qa'im, Al-'Amariyah, al-'Anbar, 'Ayn and 'Albu'l-Khazraj, which are located on the border with Syria. The JOC statement did not specify the number of people who were killed or wounded during the battle. It added that ""the liberation of these villages is a major blow to the terrorist group, as they are the last remaining strongholds of the ISIL in Iraq."" The statement also noted that Iraq's security forces are now in full control of all the areas that were captured by ISIL, including the city of Ramadi, the provincial capital of Salahuddin province. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al Abadi said in a televised address that his government will continue to fight the terrorists until they leave Iraq. ""We will not allow them to return to Iraq,"" he said, adding that ISIL ""will pay a heavy price for their crimes."" ISIL has been fighting Iraqi government forces since June 2014, when it overran large parts of northern and western Iraq, where it declared an Islamic ""caliphate"" and declared its leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi its caliph. Since then, it has carried out a series of deadly attacks across the country, killing thousands of Iraqis and displacing tens of thousands more. ISIL is also believed to be responsible for a string of suicide bombings in Baghdad and other Iraqi cities over the past year that have killed more than 300 people.",0

It can be done for a variety of reasons, such as economic, cultural, religious, or political reasons. The most common reason for emigration is to seek a better life in another country. However, there are many other reasons as well. For example, some people choose to emigrate because they want to live in a country where they can practice their religion freely. Others may be motivated by a desire to be closer to their family or friends in the country they are leaving. Some people may also be seeking a new start in their lives, and are looking to make a life for themselves in an unfamiliar place. In some cases, emigrants may have a specific reason to leave their home country, but they may not be able to return to that country due to a lack of resources or a conflict with the local government. If you are thinking of leaving your country of origin, it is important to understand the reasons behind your decision and what you will be doing once you arrive in your new home.

(CBSNewYork/AP) — A new track set to re-open at the Port Authority Bus Terminal is expected to be completed by June, officials said Wednesday. The track, which was damaged in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, will be replaced with a new one that will allow trains to run more frequently. ""It's going to take a little bit of time, but we're confident that we'll be able to get it done by the end of the year,"" said Patrick Foye, a spokesman for New Jersey Transit, the agency that operates the bus terminal. He said the work will cost about $1.5 million and take about a year to complete. It's the first time the track has been replaced since it was destroyed in a fire in 2001. A second track was also damaged during the attack, and a third was repaired in 2003, Foyle said. In addition to the new tracks, there are also plans to replace the overhead power lines that carry power to and from the terminal, as well as the electrical substations that provide power for the terminals' elevators and escalators. There is also a plan to install new lighting and other improvements to make the area more attractive to tourists and commuters. Foyer of Terminal 4 ""The new terminal will have a much more modern look and feel than what we have now,"" he said, adding that it will also be more accessible to people with disabilities, who often use wheelchairs or walkers to reach the train platforms. But he cautioned that the improvements won't be complete until the project is completed, so it's not yet clear how many people will use the facility once it is open. New Yorkers will still have to wait a few more months to ride the trains, though, because the tracks will not be open until mid-June.",0

The Palestinian Health Ministry said the man, who was in his 20s, was killed when Israeli soldiers opened fire on a group of Palestinian youths who were throwing stones at them. An Israeli army spokesperson told Ma'an that the soldiers fired warning shots at the youths before opening fire. No injuries were reported from the incident, which took place at around 2:30 p.m. local time (1130 GMT). The spokesperson added that a number of Palestinians were injured during the clashes, but did not provide further details. A spokesperson for the Palestinian Ministry of Health said in a statement: ""The Israeli occupation forces shot dead a Palestinian youth in an illegal Israeli settlement in al-'Aqsa village, east of the city of Nablus, and injured several others, including women and children, during clashes with the youth."" The statement also said that ""Israeli forces fired live ammunition, rubber-coated steel bullets, tear gas canisters, stun grenades and live bullets at Palestinian civilians, causing them to suffer from suffocation and shock."" Palestinian medics said at least 10 people had been injured in clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops. Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said ""the soldiers were responding to stone-throwing by Palestinians."" He added, ""We will not tolerate the throwing of Molotov cocktails and firebombs at Israeli civilians. We will continue to act in accordance with international law and to protect the lives of our soldiers and the citizens of Israel."" In response to the shooting, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for a ""day of rage"" on Monday. ""I call on the people of Palestine to take the day off from work to protest against the killing of a young Palestinian,"" he said, according to an official statement from his office. He also called on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ""immediately stop the escalation of violence, to end the occupation and its crimes against Palestinian children and their families."" Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said an investigation was underway and that no arrests had yet been made. According to Israeli media reports, the soldier who shot the young man is a member of an elite unit called the Iron Dome anti-missile defense system. It was not immediately clear if he was a soldier on active duty or a reservist. In a separate incident on Saturday, an Israeli soldier was lightly injured when a rock was thrown at him from a passing car in Jerusalem's Old City, police said. Israel's Channel 2 news reported that police were investigating the case as a possible ""terror attack."" A video posted on social media appeared to show a man throwing a stone at a police car, before being shot by the car's driver as he tried to flee the scene. Police said they had arrested a suspect in connection with that incident. Earlier this month, two Israeli teenagers were killed and a third was seriously wounded when they were hit by a firebomb thrown by an ultra-Orthodox Jewish man near a bus stop in Hebron, near the Israeli-Palestinian border. That attack was the second in less than a week, following a stabbing attack in Tel Aviv that left one person dead and another seriously injured. On Friday, a 17-year-old Palestinian boy was stabbed to death and two other people were lightly wounded in separate attacks in East Jerusalem, where Palestinians have been carrying out a wave of stabbings, shootings and car-rammings in recent weeks.

5621,Oladipo scores career-high 47 as Pacers beat Nuggets in OT,"By ANNE M. PETERSON
Posted Feb 06 2014 12:24AM INDIANAPOLIS (AP) Paul George and Roy Hibbert had their way with the Denver Nuggets. So did David West and George Hill. And so did the Indiana Pacers, who beat the Nuggets 104-97 on Wednesday night for their fourth straight victory. ""We're just trying to get better,"" George said. The Pacers have won four straight and seven of their last eight games, and they're on the verge of becoming the first team in NBA history to win at least 50 games and make the playoffs in the same season. They're also on pace to set a franchise record for wins in a season, surpassing the 50-win mark set by the 1995-96 team that went to the Western Conference finals and lost to Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls in six games. George scored a team-best 47 points, including the go-ahead 3-pointer with 2.9 seconds left in overtime, to help the Pacers snap a three-game losing streak. West scored 20 points and Hill added 17 for Indiana, which has won six of its last seven games at Pepsi Center and is 7-1 in its past nine home games against Denver. Paul Millsap added 16 points for the Hawks, while Danilo Gallinari and Wilson Chandler each had 13. Denver's Kenneth Faried finished with 12 points on 4-of-14 shooting. He was the only player in double figures for a Nuggets team playing without starting point guard Ty Lawson (sprained right ankle) and starting center Jusuf Nurkic (right knee tendinitis). ""It was a tough loss,"" said Nuggets coach Brian Shaw, whose team was outscored by a combined 52-34 over the final three quarters of Wednesday's loss to San Antonio and two games to open the season against the Los Angeles Lakers. Shaw said he was ""disappointed"" with his team's effort, but he didn't think it was as bad as it looked on film. It was just the second time this season that Denver has allowed more than 100 points in an overtime game, according to Elias Sports Bureau research. In the other two, the team went on to lose both of those games - both at home - to Golden State and Oklahoma City. Nuggets forward Darrell Arthur was ejected with 1:36 left after he shoved West in frustration. Arthur said after the game that he thought West was going to",0

5763,Nutella scuffles: France investigates discounts after frenzy," over chocolate spread
The French government has launched an investigation into claims that the country's biggest supermarket chain, Carrefour, is offering discounts of up to 50 per cent on some of its most popular products.According to a report in the French newspaper Le Monde, the discounts are being offered on products such as chocolate, coffee, tea, chocolate bars, biscuits and chocolate-flavoured pastries, as well as a wide range of other food and drink items. The discounts range from as little as 20 to as much as 50 percent off the price of the product, according to the report. It is not clear how many products have been affected by the discounting, but it is thought to be a widespread practice across the company's stores in France and other European countries, including Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. A spokesman for the supermarket said: 'We do not comment on rumours or speculation. We are looking into the matter.' The newspaper said it had obtained a copy of a letter sent by a senior official at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, which is responsible for food safety. In the letter, he said the ministry had received complaints from consumers that some products were being sold at a discount. He added that it would be 'inappropriate' to comment further until the investigation had been completed. But the newspaper quoted the official as saying that if the allegations were true, they would constitute 'a serious breach of consumer protection laws'. The scandal comes just weeks after it was revealed that Tesco, Britain's largest supermarket group, was offering its customers a 'buy one, get one free' offer on its own-brand products, in an apparent attempt to boost sales.",0

The commercial, which was shot in Los Angeles, features Pratt in a scene from the movie where he plays a superhero named Rocket Raccoon. In the scene, Pratt's character is being chased by the villainous Groot (voiced by Dave Bautista), who is trying to steal the Guardians' spaceship, the Ego-1, from them. Pratt plays Rocket, and the commercial features him playing the role of Rocket's best friend, a raccoon named R2-D2.
The commercial was filmed in front of a green screen, so it's hard to tell exactly what's going on, but it seems like Pratt is playing Rocket as he runs away from a group of bad guys who are chasing him. It's not clear if he's actually running away, or if the chase is just part of his character's routine. Either way, he seems to be playing a character who doesn't have a lot of superpowers. He's just a regular guy who happens to have the ability to fly and shoot lasers from his eyes.",0

The lawsuit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Seattle, alleges that Murray, who is running for re-election, is a ""serial child molester"" who has sexually abused at least four women over the course of his political career, including one who was 14 years old at the time of the alleged abuse. The woman, identified in court documents as Jane Doe No. 1, says she met Murray when he was an elected official in Washington, D.C., and he invited her to a party at his home. She says that after the party, she went back to his house and had sex with him, which she says lasted for about an hour and a half. Afterward, the woman says, Murray asked her if she wanted to have sex again, and she said no. Murray then allegedly told her that he would ""take care of"" her, according to the lawsuit.

The governor's office announced Tuesday that it has reached an agreement with the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y., for the naming rights of the Colorado Rockies baseball team. The agreement is expected to be finalized by the end of this month, according to a press release from the Governor's Office. ""This is a great day for baseball in Colorado,"" said Governor H.B. King, who has been a longtime supporter of Major League Baseball's efforts to bring the sport back to the Rocky Mountain state. In addition to naming the team the Rockies, the agreement will also allow the museum to use the name ""Colorado Rockies"" on its website and social media accounts, and will include the use of ""Rockies"" as the primary logo on all merchandise, including hats, T-shirts, caps and other apparel.
""We are very pleased to have reached this agreement and look forward to continuing to work together on this important project,"" the governor said in the release. A press conference will be held at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, Aug. 1, in front of a statue of former Colorado Governor Bill Owens, which is located at Coors Field in downtown Denver, to unveil the new team name and logo, as well as a commemorative plaque to honor the former governor and his efforts in bringing baseball to Colorado. For more information, visit www.colorado.gov/colleges/baseball or call 303-441-6200..... The Colorado House of Representatives voted Tuesday to approve a bill that would rename the University of Colorado football team ""The Buffaloes."" The bill, sponsored by Rep. Dan Pabon, D-Aurora, passed the House by a vote of 98-0, with one abstention. It will now go before the Senate, where it will need a two-thirds majority to pass before becoming law. If the bill is signed into law, it would be the first time in state history that a state university would have its name changed to reflect its athletics program. Under the proposal, Colorado State University would retain its current name, while the Buffs would become the second-highest-ranked team in Division I football, behind only Ohio State.",0

The Vatican said in a statement on Wednesday that the expert, Fr. Federico Lombardi, would be in Santiago on Thursday to assist in the case of Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, who has been accused of sexually abusing children in his diocese between the 1970s and the 1990s. The statement did not say when he would arrive in Chile, but said he was expected to arrive ""in the next few days"". The Vatican also said it was sending a letter of apology to Sanchez and his family, as well as to other victims of abuse. ""The Holy See is deeply saddened by the allegations against the bishop,"" the statement said, adding that it had been in contact with Sanchez's family and would continue to do so. It said Sanchez was ""a man of great integrity and dignity"" who had ""served the Church with great love and devotion for many years"". It added: ""He has always been a model of pastoral care, and he will be sorely missed by all those who knew him."" Sanchez has denied the accusations against him, saying they were part of a ""smear campaign"" and that he had never molested a child. He has not been charged with any crime. Sanchez is the first bishop in Latin America to face criminal charges in connection with allegations of child abuse, which have rocked the Catholic Church in recent years.",0

Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Bronx landlord accused of slacking on repairs / Bronx tenants sue landlord for failing to fix broken elevators 1 /, & / Image 2 of 1 A broken elevator is seen in the lobby of a Bronx apartment building where tenants allege that a landlord has been slow to repair the building. The building is owned by the Bronx-based landlord, who is also the landlord of another building on the same block, according to a lawsuit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court by tenants who say they are owed thousands of dollars in unpaid rent. In the lawsuit, the tenants claim that they have been unable to move out of their apartments because they can't afford to pay the rent, which is $2,000 a month. A Bronx tenant who lives in a building with a similar history to the one in which she lives says she is owed more than $1,500 in back rent after she was evicted from her apartment last year because she couldn't pay her rent on time. She says that when she tried to file a complaint with the city's Rent Stabilization Board, she says the board told her that she would have to go to court to get her money back. ""They told me that if I didn't do it, they would take it from me,"" the tenant, whose name is not being used, says in an interview with NPR's Robert Siegel. Her apartment is in one of three buildings on a block that has a history of rent-stabilized apartments that were built before the 1980s, when rent control was enacted. It's not clear how many tenants live in these buildings, or how long they've been in them. According to city records, there are about 1,200 rent stabilized apartments in Brooklyn alone, but the number is likely much higher, because many of them are in older buildings that are not subject to rent stabilization. Rent stabilization is a state law that requires landlords to set aside a certain amount of money each month to cover the cost of paying rent to low- and moderate-income tenants. Under the law, landlords are required to give tenants at least 30 days' notice before they raise their rent or evict them for nonpayment. If a tenant does not pay rent within the 30-day period, he or she loses the right to stay in his or her rental unit for a set period of time, usually one to three years. But in some cases, tenants are able to keep their rental units even if they don't make rent payments. For example, if a renter fails to make a rent payment for three consecutive months, that tenant can keep the apartment for up to one year after the first month's rent is paid. This is known as ""tenant-initiated rent abatement,"" or TIRA. Some tenants say that their landlords have not paid rent for months at a time and have refused to let them move in until they pay up. Others say the buildings are infested with cockroaches and other pests that make it difficult for them to find a place to live. One tenant told NPR that he and his wife have lived in this building for about a year and a half. He says he has paid his rent in full every month for the past two years and has never had a problem with his landlord. Another tenant said she and her husband moved into their apartment about two months ago. They said they were told by their landlord that there was a cockroach infestation in their unit and that it would cost them about $500 to clean it",0

Both were from Brooklyn, and both were members of a unit that patrols the streets of Brooklyn and the surrounding areas.

In the case of Glowforge, the idea was to create a 3-D laser printer that would allow people to print objects out of plastic, metal, glass, and other materials. It would also be able to do so at a fraction of the cost of a traditional laser cutter, making it more accessible to people who might not otherwise have access to such a device. And it would do it all for less than $1,000, a price tag that made it one of Kickstarter's most successful campaigns of all time.",0

5504,India says economy poised to grow by 7-7.5 percent," in 2016-17New Delhi: India's gross domestic product (GDP) growth is expected to accelerate to 7.7 per cent in the current financial year, according to a report released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday.
 the report said that the Indian economy is projected to expand at an average annual rate of 6.9 percent from April 2016 to March 2017, which is higher than the average growth of 5.8 percent during the previous five years. The report also said the economy will grow at a faster pace in 2017-18 and 2018-19 than it did in 2015-16, when it grew at 7 percent. ""Growth in India will be driven by strong private consumption and a pick-up in investment,"" the IMF said in its World Economic Outlook (WEO) 2017 report.
The report, however, cautioned that there are risks to the economic outlook, including a slowdown in external demand, a rise in global commodity prices, and the possibility of political instability in some emerging market economies, particularly in Brazil and South Africa. It also pointed out that fiscal consolidation is likely to weigh on growth over the next few years, as the government seeks to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.1 percent of GDP by fiscal 2019-20, from a peak of 8.2 percent at the end of 2016.",0

Terry McAuliffe signed a bill Thursday that will allow terminally ill patients in the state to access experimental drugs that have not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The bill, which passed the House of Delegates on a voice vote and now heads to the governor's desk for his signature, was sponsored by Del. Robert G. Marshall (R-Prince William) and Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel (D-Fairfax). It was introduced in response to a lawsuit filed by a group of patients who were denied access to investigational drugs because the FDA had not approved the drugs. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the Virginia Patient Advocacy Alliance (VPAA), a non-profit organization that advocates for the rights of Virginia patients with life-threatening illnesses, including cancer, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, and Parkinson's disease.
.@GovernorMcAuliffe signs Virginia bill to allow patients suffering from terminal illnesses to get experimental treatments. pic.twitter.com/q9Jf8x8zvB — The Associated Press (@AP) June 22, 2017
 the bill would allow a patient with a terminal illness to apply for an experimental drug that has not been tested in humans. If the drug is approved, the patient would be able to take it for a limited period of time and then have it removed from the list of approved drugs if it does not improve their quality of life. Patients would have to pay the full cost of their drug, but they would not be required to use it if they do not want to. They would also have the right to sue the pharmaceutical company that makes the medication if the company fails to provide them with the treatment they need.",0

The budget shortfall is the result of lower-than-expected revenue from the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which is projected to cost the federal government $109 billion over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The ACA, also known as Obamacare, was passed by Congress in 2010 and was signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. It requires most Americans to have health insurance or pay a fine. In addition, the ACA requires states to expand Medicaid, a federal-state program that provides health coverage to low-income individuals and families with incomes up to 138 percent of federal poverty level (about $15,000 for a family of four in 2013 dollars). In 2014, states will be able to opt out of Medicaid expansion, but they will not be required to do so. As a result, more than 20 states have not expanded their Medicaid programs to include children and adults under the age of 18. According to HHS, this will result in an additional $3.6 billion in federal spending for Medicaid in 2014 and $4.4 billion more in 2015.
.. View gallery..
""This is a surprise,"" HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday. ""It's not something that we've anticipated."" The shortfall, she said, is due to a combination of factors, including a lower than expected number of people signing up for coverage through HealthCare.gov, as well as the fact that more people are enrolling in Medicare Part D, an insurance program for seniors, than previously expected. However, there is no indication that the shortfall will increase in the near future, Bur well said. She added that HHS will continue to work with states and the private sector to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions have access to affordable health care coverage.",0

The ruling is a blow to the BJP and RSS, both of which have been campaigning hard for Modi to win a third term as prime minister. It is the first time that a court has struck down a provision of the Representation of People's Act, or the RPA, that allows candidates to use their religion or caste as a reason for disqualifying themselves from running for office, according to a report in The New York Times.",0

CLEVELAND (Reuters) - LeBron James scored 24 points, Kyrie Irving added 21 and the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Miami Heat in their NBA debut on Friday night, winning for the first time without All-Star forward Kevin Love.

The Cavaliers (1-0) won their first game since trading Love to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Aug. 20, but the Heat (0-1) were without their leading scorer, forward Chris Bosh, who is recovering from blood clots in his lungs. The Heat were also without starting point guard Goran Dragic and starting shooting guard Dion Waiters, both of whom were out with injuries. ""It was a tough night for us,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra told the team's official website after the game, adding that Bosh's absence was ""a big blow."" ""We're going to have to figure out a way to win without him."" The Cavaliers led by as many as 20 points in a game for only the second time this season, the other time coming against the New York Knicks on Oct. 19. James, Irving and Tristan Thompson all scored in double figures for Cleveland, which has won its first two games by an average of 23.3 points. It was the Cavaliers' first win over a team with a winning record since beating the Los Angeles Lakers on Nov. 2, 2015. Miami, meanwhile, fell to 0-2 on its five-game homestand, with its only win coming over the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday night. Dwyane Wade led Miami with 21 points and eight assists, while Hassan Whiteside added 18 points on 7-of-11 shooting. Whitesides' performance was his first in more than a month, as he has missed the last three games because of a strained left hamstring. He is listed as day-to-day and is not expected to play in Saturday's game at the Indiana Pacers, according to a Heat team spokesman. Heat guard Wayne Ellington was held scoreless in 12 minutes of action and finished with eight points off the bench for Miami",0

6187,Luton hospital failed to spot fatal sepsis in child suffering from chicken pox,", inquest hearsAn inquest into the death of a four-year-old boy who died of septic shock after being treated at a hospital in Luton has heard how the boy's mother was told by staff at the hospital that her son had been diagnosed with a bacterial infection.
The inquest heard that the mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was taken to the emergency department of the children's hospital on the morning of April 10, 2013, after she complained of chest pains. She was given antibiotics and sent home, but the following day she returned to hospital complaining of severe abdominal pain. The child was admitted to intensive care, where he died on April 11, the day after his mother returned home from hospital. His death was ruled an accident by the coroner, despite the fact that he had not been given any antibiotics or any other treatment to treat the infection that had caused his illness. He had also not received any treatment for the chickenpox he was infected with, which was later confirmed to be the cause of his death by a post mortem examination. A post-mortem examination found the child had died from septicaemia, a potentially life-threatening infection caused by an infection with the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (commonly known as ""staph""). The infection can be fatal if left untreated, and it can also lead to serious complications such as kidney failure and brain damage. It is estimated that up to 1,000 children die each year in the UK as a result of staph infections in hospitals, although the exact figure is difficult to estimate because of under-reporting by hospitals and the lack of national statistics.

3386,McDonald's reaches settlement in 'joint-employer' lawsuit,"A McDonald's franchisee has reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Labor in a class-action lawsuit alleging that the fast-food chain violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) by paying its franchisees less than the federal minimum wage and overtime pay. The settlement was announced today by the Department's Wage and Hour Division, which is responsible for enforcing the FLSA, and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which enforces the NLRA. Under the terms of the settlement, the company will pay $1.5 million to the plaintiffs and $500,000 in attorneys' fees and costs, as well as an additional $2.2 million in back wages and benefits to franchise employees.
The settlement resolves a complaint filed in the District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of more than 1,500 franchise workers who worked at McDonalds restaurants in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Westchester County, N.Y., between January 1 and December 31, 2012. In the complaint, plaintiffs alleged that McDonald�s failed to pay them at least the federally mandated minimum hourly wage of $7.25 per hour for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week. Plaintiffs also claimed that they were not paid overtime for any time worked over 40, nor were they paid for time spent off the clock, such as vacation, sick leave, or personal time off. They also alleged violations of their right to form a union and to collectively bargain for better wages, hours and working conditions, among other things. As a result of these allegations, they sought to represent themselves in court and sought injunctive relief to prevent the defendants from continuing to violate their rights to organize and bargain collectively. After a three-week trial, a jury found for plaintiffs on all counts and awarded them $3.3 million. McDonald´s appealed the jury's verdict, arguing that it was not entitled to summary judgment on the merits because it did not meet its burden of showing that plaintiffs had standing to bring the case. On appeal, however, we reversed the district court� decision and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We now affirm the trial court's order granting plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction and for an award of attorneys� fees, costs and expenses. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and we remand the matter to that court with instructions to enter an order enjoining",0

900,Encryption in government’s crosshairs,"In the wake of Edward Snowden's revelations about the National Security Agency's (NSA) mass surveillance programs, the Obama administration has taken a number of steps to limit the government's ability to spy on Americans. The most significant of these has been the passage of the USA Freedom Act, a bill that would end the NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone records. However, as the New York Times reported last week, this is not the end of NSA surveillance. In fact, it is only the beginning of a new era in which the agency will be able to collect even more information about Americans, including the content of their phone calls, emails, and web browsing history. As the Times notes, ""The new law, which was approved by the House of Representatives and the Senate last month, would allow the intelligence community to search through vast databases of telephone and Internet records for information on people who are not suspected of any wrongdoing. It would also allow intelligence agencies to share the information with other federal agencies and with state and local law enforcement agencies."" In other words, if you are a suspect in a crime, you could be swept up in this new surveillance dragnet, just as you would have been under the Bush administration's warrantless wiretapping program.
The Times also notes that the new bill ""would not require a court order to obtain the records, but it would require that they be stored for at least five years."" This means that, in the future, Americans will have no way of knowing how much information is being collected on them, or how long it will take for that information to be used. This is especially troubling given the fact that there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that this type of surveillance has a chilling effect on the exercise of First Amendment rights. For example, last year, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, published a study that found that people were less likely to speak out about political issues if they knew that their communications were being monitored. And, according to a recent report from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), ""the government has used the Patriot Act's Section 215 to secretly collect the telephone records of tens of millions of law-abiding Americans without a warrant or even a suspicion of wrongdoing."" The ACLU also points out that ""Section 215 has also been used to target journalists, activists, lawyers and others who have criticized the U.S. government or its policies abroad."" As a result of all of this, many Americans are beginning to question whether they should trust their government to protect them from government overreach.",0

""This is not a peace march. It is a march for Islamization,"" said UIC head Uwe Böhnhardt in a statement on Friday. ""It is an attack on our freedom of religion and our way of life,"" he said, adding that the march would be attended by hundreds of thousands of people, including many from the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD) and the neo-Nazi National Socialist Underground (NSU), which has been linked to the murder of nine people at a music festival in Bavaria last year. The NPD and NSU are both known for their anti-Semitic and racist views, and both have been banned from holding public rallies in recent years by the German government. In the wake of last week's deadly terror attacks in Paris, which were claimed by Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) militants, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called on Muslims to show ""solidarity"" with the French people and to ""remain vigilant"" against the threat posed by IS. Börje Stoltenberg, a member of Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, said on Thursday that she was ""deeply concerned"" about the planned march, calling it a ""dangerous"" and ""unacceptable"" event. He added that it was not the right time for such an event to take place, given the current situation in France, where the government has imposed a state of emergency following the attacks on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket in January that left 17 people dead.",0

3581,"Hardaway, Beasley lead Knicks past depleted Bulls, 110-92","By ANTONIO GONZALEZ and JONATHAN KARLMAN
Posted Feb 06 2013 12:00AM
, NEW YORK (AP) The New York Knicks had a chance to win the game in the final seconds of the fourth quarter, but they couldn't get it done. Carmelo Anthony scored a season-high 35 points and the Knicks beat the depleted Chicago Bulls 109-102 on Wednesday night. ""It was a great win for us,"" Anthony said. Derrick Rose added 20 points, and Raymond Felton added 17 for the Bulls. The Knicks, who have lost four of five, were down by as many as 17 points early in this one. But they rallied to tie it at 89 on Anthony's 3-pointer with 1.9 seconds left. Rose then hit a 3 to make it a two-possession game. Anthony hit two free throws with 0.3 seconds remaining to give the Garden faithful something to cheer about. He finished with 34 points on 10-of-16 shooting. New Jersey's Derrick Williams had 18 points for Chicago, which had lost five of six. Joakim Noah had 16 points off the bench and Nikola Mirotic had 14 points to lead a Bulls team that was outscored by an average of 17.5 points in its previous two games. Chicago's defense was so bad that it gave up an easy layup by Rose with 2.8 seconds to play. It was the first time the team had given up a lay-up in a playoff game since the 1995-96 season, when it lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in seven games in Game 7 of their first-round series. That was also the last time Chicago lost a game on the road to a team with a winning record, according to STATS. Knicks coach Mike Woodson said he didn't know if his team would be able to get back on track after the loss to Chicago and that he was disappointed with the way the second half went for him and his players. They were outrebounded 52-36 and shot just 38 percent. Wooderson said the defense had to be better, especially against Rose, the NBA's leading scorer at 28.7 points per game and an All-Star who has scored at least 30 in each of his last four games, including a 30-point, 12-rebound effort in Wednesday's win over the New Orleans Pelicans. In addition, he said, it was",0

The spokesperson added that the ambulance was transporting the man from the scene of clashes between Palestinian youths and Israeli security forces to the al-Aqsa hospital in occupied East Jerusalem, where he is being treated for injuries sustained during the clashes. ""An investigation has been opened into the circumstances of the incident,"" the spokesperson, Micky Rosenfeld, said in a statement. He did not provide further details about the investigation. A spokesperson for the Palestinian Prisoner's Society said that they were not aware of any ambulance being used to transport the injured man, and that he had been taken to an Israeli hospital for treatment. Palestinian medics have been using ambulances to carry injured Palestinians to Israeli hospitals in order to receive medical treatment in an effort to prevent them from being transferred to Palestinian hospitals that do not have the necessary equipment to treat them. In the past, Palestinians have also been injured while attempting to cross the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights into Syria to join the ranks of Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL).",0

7964,AP Analysis: Rio de Janeiro Olympics cost $13.1 billion,"The cost of hosting the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil is expected to top $14 billion, according to a new report from the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The report, which is based on an analysis of the IOC's financial projections for the Rio Games, shows that the Games will be the most expensive in Olympic history, with an estimated $12.7 billion in costs. The IOC estimates the total cost to be $15.4 billion.
.@IOM_Rio: Cost of #Olympics in #Brazil is estimated at $11.6B, including $1.2B for infrastructure. pic.twitter.com/qjz8q6Qj9z — IOC (@IOSoccer) August 31, 2016
, the report says that Rio's infrastructure will cost an average of $2.5 billion per year. That's more than twice as much as the next-highest-cost city, Tokyo, where the average cost is $500 million. In addition to the infrastructure costs, Rio will also have to pay for a host of other expenses, such as security, transportation, and other costs associated with hosting a major international sporting event.The report also notes that there are a number of factors that could affect the cost. For example, if the Olympics were held in the United States, costs would be lower because the U.S. government would not be required to foot the bill. However, that's not necessarily the case. If the Olympic Games were to take place in another country, it would require the host country to cover the costs of infrastructure and security.In addition, there is also the question of whether or not the city of Rio would have the financial resources to host the games. Rio is a large city with a population of about 22 million people, making it the second-largest city in South America, after Buenos Aires. It's also home to many of Brazil's most popular tourist attractions, like Copacabana Beach and the Maracanã Stadium.",0

Gambia's President Yahya Jammeh has been in power since independence from Britain in 1960. He is the longest-serving head of state in Africa, having ruled the country for more than half a century. 3. The country has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world. 4. In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that Gambian women were the most likely to die from pregnancy-related causes. 5. According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), nearly half of all Gambians live below the poverty line. 6. More than a quarter of children under the age of five are malnourished. 7. A recent report by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) found that nearly one in five children living in rural areas were stunted due to lack of access to safe water and sanitation. 8. One in four children in urban areas are underweight. 9. Nearly one-third of women are married before they reach age 18. 10. Women are the primary breadwinners in nearly 90 percent of households, and the majority of them are women of childbearing age. 11. There are an estimated 2.5 million children who live in extreme poverty, with an average annual income of less than $1,000. 12. Roughly two-thirds of these children are born out of wedlock. 13. Half of those who die of preventable causes are children. 14. An estimated one million people die each year as a direct result of unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene. 15. At least 1,500 children die every day from diseases such as measles, whooping cough, malaria and tuberculosis. 16. Approximately 1 in 5 children suffer from severe malnutrition. 17. Almost half the population lives in areas with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) — including chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), which causes genital warts and genital ulcerations. 18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170,171,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,190,191,192,193,194,195,196,197,198,199,200,201,202,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,210,211,212,213,214,215,216,217,218,219,220,221,222,223,224,225,226,227,228,229,230,231,232",0

3488,DeRozan scores 23 as Raptors beat Timberwolves 109-104,"By ANTONIO GONZALEZ-USA TODAY Spor
TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto Raptors forward DeMarre Carroll scored 23 points, and the Raptors overcame a sluggish start to beat the Minnesota Timberwolves on Tuesday night, 109 to 104.
, the team's leading scorer, had 19 points and 10 rebounds for his first double-double of the season. He also had six assists and four steals. The Raptors, who have won four of five, are in first place in the Atlantic Division. ""It was a great win for us,"" said Raptors coach Dwane Casey, whose team has won five of its last six games. ""(Carroll) is a big part of what we're doing right now. We have a lot of guys who can score the ball and he's one of them."" The Timberwolves (2-3) were coming off a loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday night. They had lost three straight and seven of their last eight games before Tuesday's win. But they had won three of four before that, including a 104-101 victory over the New York Knicks on Sunday. Ricky Rubio scored a season-high 27 points for Minnesota, which has lost six of seven. It was the Timberwolves' first win over Toronto since Nov. 29, 2010. Rubio had a team-best 20 points in that game, but he was held to nine in this one. Toronto's Kyle Lowry had 18 points on 7-of-13 shooting. Rookie guard Terrence Ross had 13 points. Minnesota's Kevin Love had 17 points off the bench after missing the previous two games with a sprained left ankle. Love has missed the last three games because of a strained left hamstring. Timberwolves coach Rick Adelman said he didn't know if Love would be able to play Wednesday against the Philadelphia 76ers. Lowry, meanwhile, is expected to be a game-time decision for Wednesday's home game with the Washington Wizards. Casey said Lowry's status for the game against Washington will be determined after the All-Star break, when he'll be evaluated by team physician Dr. James Andrews. In the first quarter, Lowry was called for a technical foul for arguing a call on the court. Afterward, he said, ""I was just trying to get a foul called on me. I don't think I did anything wrong."" He was whistled for an offensive foul on a layup by Kevin Martin with 1:12 left. Martin",0

3601,Knicks rout Nets again to finish sweep of season series,"NEW YORK (AP) — The New York Knicks beat the Brooklyn Nets for the second time in three days, this time by a final score of 107-97 on Wednesday night.
, who had missed the previous two games with a sprained left ankle, scored a season-high 27 points to lead the Knicks to a fourth straight victory. He also had 10 rebounds and six assists. ""I'm just happy to be back out there,"" he said. The Knicks have won four in a row over the Nets, including the last three by an average of 17.5 points. Deron Williams added 17 points and eight assists for New Jersey, which has lost three straight and seven of its last eight. It was the third straight loss for Nets coach Jason Kidd, whose team has been outscored by at least 20 points in each of the past three games. Kidd said he didn't know if his team would be able to get back on track against a Knicks team that has won six of seven and is in the midst of a three-game road trip. Brooklyn had a chance to tie the game at the end of regulation, but J.R. Smith's 3-pointer bounced off the backboard and out of bounds with 1.9 seconds left. Williams made two free throws with 0.3 seconds remaining to give the Garden crowd a victory it had been waiting for for more than a month. Nets guard Jason Terry missed a jumper with 2.1 seconds to play, and the crowd erupted in celebration when the ball hit the rim and ricocheted off Terry's leg and into the stands. Terry said afterward that he thought he was going to have to go to the locker room because of pain in his ankle. But he stayed in and played the final 2 1/2 minutes, finishing with 10 points on 4-of-8 shooting and five rebounds. Knicks coach Mike Woodson said the team was ""disappointed"" with the way it lost the first game, when it trailed by as many as 14 points with less than five minutes left in regulation. That led to an 11-0 run that gave them the lead for good, then a 14-2 spurt that put them back in front, only to see it slip away again in overtime. In the extra period, Williams hit a 3 from the right corner to make it a one-possession game. After a timeout, Kidd called timeout and called for a shot clock violation. When it was called,",0

The letter was sent to UC President Janet Napolitano and UC Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks on Friday, and was provided to The Fix by a source with knowledge of the investigation.

""The investigation is ongoing,"" the letter reads. ""We will provide more information as it becomes available."" The office did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Daily Californian, but a spokesperson told the campus newspaper that the office is ""conducting a thorough review of all aspects of this event and will continue to work with the university community to ensure a safe and respectful environment for all of our students, faculty, staff and visitors."" A spokesperson for Berkeley also declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation, which was first reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. In a statement to Campus Reform, UC spokesperson Dan Mogulof said, ""UC Berkeley is committed to providing an environment that is free of harassment, intimidation and discrimination. We will not tolerate harassment or discrimination of any kind on our campus, in our community or anywhere in the world."" ""The university is conducting this investigation to determine whether there were any violations of federal laws related to discrimination, harassment and retaliation, as well as whether any policies or procedures were not followed,"" he added. According to an email sent by UC officials to students and staff on Thursday, students were asked to stay away from the Berkeley campus from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p. m. on Monday, August 22, due to concerns about the safety of those attending the event. Those who were unable to attend were allowed to return to their dorms or other off-campus locations. Students were also asked not to bring cell phones, laptops, cameras, or any other electronic devices into campus buildings or on campus-owned property. Campus police also advised students to avoid the area around Sproul Plaza, where a large number of people were expected to gather to watch the celestial event from a vantage point at the corner of Telegraph Avenue and Martin Luther King Jr. Way. Berkeley Police Chief Margo Bennett said in a press release that she was ""deeply troubled"" by what she described as a ""disturbing pattern of behavior"" that included ""verbal and physical harassment"" and ""threats of violence."" She also said that police had received numerous calls from students reporting that they were being harassed by people who said they wanted to ""kill"" them or ""beat them up,"" and that officers had responded to at least one incident in which a student was threatened with a gun. Bennett added that Berkeley police were ""working closely"" with other law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and the Secret Service, to investigate the incident. She said she had not yet spoken to any students who claimed to have been the victims of physical or verbal harassment. On Friday afternoon, Bennett released a written statement that read in part: ""I want to assure you that we are taking this matter very seriously and are working closely with our local, state and federal partners to conduct a full and thorough investigation of what happened on August 21. I want you to know that I am deeply troubled by this behavior. It is not tolerated at Berkeley and we will do everything we can to make sure that it does not happen again."" Bennett's statement also noted that ""the university has a zero-tolerance policy for any form of discrimination or harassment,"" adding that any student found to be in violation of that policy could be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion. As of press time, no one had been expelled from Berkeley for violating the school's anti-harassment policy, nor had anyone been arrested or charged with any criminal offense.

Poland and Israel agree to a ceasefire in the Golan Heights in exchange for Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories, the Polish Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. the statement said that the two sides had agreed to the ceasefire, which was to take effect at 11:00 a.m. local time on Thursday. The statement did not say how long the truce would last, but it said it would be in effect for at least 24 hours. It said the agreement was reached at a meeting between Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski and his Israeli counterpart, Tzipi Livni, in Jerusalem on Tuesday night. ""The Polish and Israeli sides have agreed on the implementation of the Minsk agreements,"" the ministry said, referring to an agreement reached in February between Ukraine, Russia, France, Germany and the United States to end the conflict in Ukraine's east. According to Polish media reports, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was present at the meeting. Israel and Poland have been at odds for years over the status of Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a holy site for Jews, Muslims and Christians. Poland has refused to recognize Israel as a Jewish state, and Hashemite Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has called for a boycott of Polish products. In March, Poland's foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, visited Israel to meet with Netanyahu and other senior Israeli officials, including Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon, who is also a member of Netanyahu's right-wing Likud Party. During his visit to Israel last month, Netanyahu said he was willing to work with Poland on a number of issues, such as the peace process, security cooperation and economic cooperation. Polish President Andrzej Duda has also expressed his willingness to cooperate with Israel on issues of mutual interest, according to his spokesman, Rafal Bochenek. A spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in Warsaw, Yigal Palmor, told Haaretz that ""the Polish government has been clear that it will not recognize the state of Israel, nor will it allow the establishment of a Palestinian state on its territory."" He added that Poland ""will continue to support Israel in its fight against terrorism and extremism."" The Polish foreign ministry statement also said",0

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Monday ordained three bishops who will serve in the Holy See's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the first time a pope has done so since the Second Vatican Council in 1962. The new bishops will be in charge of a number of parishes in Rome and the surrounding region, including the Diocese of Bologna, where the new bishop will preside over the diocese's largest parish.
...
The three new cardinals were chosen by the pope in a secret conclave that lasted more than three hours, according to Vatican officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. They were named by Francis in an address to a joint session of Congress in Washington, D.C., in which the pontiff said he had chosen them because of their ""extraordinary gifts"" to the church and their commitment to serving the poor and marginalized. ""I have chosen you because you have been called by God to serve the people of God,"" Francis said in his address, which was broadcast live on the Internet. He added that he was ""honored to have you as my brothers and sisters in Christ.""
""I am pleased to announce that I have selected you to be the next bishop of Rome,"" he said, referring to Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, archbishop of Milan, and Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio, prefect of Vatican City State, both of whom are in their 80s and have served as bishops for decades. Francis also named Cardinal Pietro Parolin, a former Vatican secretary of state and a close confidant of Pope John Paul II, to succeed him as pope emeritus. In addition, Francis named the Rev. Federico Lombardi, an Italian theologian who has been an adviser to Francis since he took office in March 2013 and is considered one of his closest confidants. Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI was the last pope to ordain a bishop from outside the Roman Curia, when he did so in 2005.",0

The paper, written by the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU), argues that the UK will be able to negotiate a ""new, comprehensive free trade agreement"" with the rest of the world after it has left the bloc. But the paper also warns that Brexit will have a negative impact on the country's economy. It says: ""In the event of a 'no deal' Brexit, it is likely that there would be a period of uncertainty and disruption to trade, investment and the movement of people. ""This would have an adverse effect on UK growth, employment and living standards."" The document, which has not yet been made public, is the first time the government has set out its thinking on how it will negotiate Britain's exit from the 28-nation bloc after the June 23 referendum.

In the wake of the opioid epidemic that has killed more than 33,000 people in the U.S. since 2000, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) have been working on a plan to combat the problem. The goal is to reduce the number of opioid-related deaths by 50 percent over the next decade. But a new report from the CDC and NIDA suggests that the plan may not be enough to stop the rise in overdose deaths.
 the report, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, found that opioid prescriptions for chronic pain — which include painkillers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone and morphine — have increased dramatically in recent years. In 2015, there were an estimated 2.5 million prescriptions written for these drugs, up from 1.8 million in 2000. And the increase has been particularly steep in states with the highest rates of prescription drug abuse, according to the study. For example, from 2000 to 2014, prescription painkiller prescriptions in New Hampshire increased by nearly 400 percent, compared to an increase of less than 100 percent in other states. (The study did not include data from states that have legalized medical marijuana, which is legal in 23 states and Washington, D.C., as well as the District of Columbia.) The increase in prescription opioid use has also been driven by a shift in how doctors prescribe the drugs. Over the past decade, doctors have increasingly been prescribing opioids to patients with chronic conditions, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, arthritis and HIV/AIDS, as opposed to those with acute pain. This has led to a spike in deaths from opioid overdoses, particularly among young people, who are",0

With the third volume coming out next week, Ghez gave Yahoo Entertainment a sneak preview of his archaeology, stunning artwork created for Disney features and shorts in the 1940s, including such masterpieces as Dumbo, Fantasia, Bambi, and Alice in Wonderland.“Half of the pieces in the book come from the Disney vault and half from the collection of the families of Disney artists. More than 90 percent of them had never been seen before in book form,” Ghez says. “Most of them had not been seen by anyone outside of the Disney Studio in more than 75 years. “Rescuing these pieces of art created by some of the most talented artists of the 20th century is immensely rewarding.”Contained here are illustrations for “The Mouse’s Tale,” a scene from Dumbo that was ultimately cut from the film, as well as the image Ghez calls “the most exceptional document featured in the book.” Click through to see.They Drew as They Pleased: The Hidden Art of Disney’s Late Golden Age: The 1940s — Part Two (Chronicle Books, $45) will be available on Oct. 10.",1

29,"Grain lower, livestock mixed"," with grain higher.This is not the first time we've heard of this phenomenon. In fact, it's been going on for a long time. It's called the ""grain-to-grain ratio"" and it was first described in a paper published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry in 2000. The paper was written by a team of researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) in Beltsville, Maryland. They found that the ratio of grain to animal protein was the most important factor in determining the amount of protein in meat and dairy products. That's because the higher the protein content of the meat or dairy, the more protein is needed to meet the body's daily protein requirements. So, if you eat a lot of meat, you'll need to eat more of it to get the same protein as someone who doesn't eat much meat at all. This is why meat is so high in saturated fat and so low in fiber, and why so many people are overweight or obese. And this is also why people who eat lots of processed foods, such as fast food, tend to have a higher protein intake than those who don't, because they're eating more processed food than they would if they were eating a more wholesome diet that included whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds and other plant-based foods.
So, what does this mean for you? It means that you should be eating at least half of your daily calories from whole, unprocessed foods like whole grain breads, pastas, rice, beans, peas, lentils, quinoa, whole-wheat tortillas, tofu, tempeh, etc. If you want to lose weight and keep it off, these are the foods that are going to help you do it.",0

But when they do, they better be ready, because we're not paying for that wall."" — Trump, interview with ABC News, Jan. 25, 2017.
REALITY: Trump has not yet issued an executive order directing the Department of Homeland Security to begin construction of a physical wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The president-elect has repeatedly said that Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for any costs associated with such a barrier, but he has offered no details on how he would accomplish that goal. In the ABC interview, Trump did not specify how much money Mexico would have to pay, only that it would be ""a very substantial amount of money"" and that ""it will work out in the formula somehow."" Trump's campaign website does not include any details about how the border wall would work, nor does it include a plan for how to fund it. Trump also said in an interview on ""Fox News Sunday"" on Dec. 1, 2016, that he was open to a ""softening"" of his stance on immigration. ""I'm not looking to hurt these people,"" he said, ""but we have some bad hombres here, and we are gonna get them out. We're gonna make a lot of progress with the people that are here right now."" However, he added that undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes should be deported, not given a path to legal status. Fact Checker rating: [637] Jan 25 2017 ""You know, I'm a very big person when it comes to the military. I have very, very strong ideas on military."" Topic: Biographical record Source: Interview Full story There is no evidence that Trump is a strong supporter of the armed forces. He has called for increasing the number of active-duty military personnel by 5,000, which would require an additional $54 billion in defense spending over the next decade, according to an analysis by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington-based think tank. Moreover, there is little evidence to support his claim that his military proposals are ""strong."" In fact, his proposed budget would cut the Army to pre-World War II levels by 2026 and the Marine Corps to levels not seen since before World War I, the analysis found",0

These metals can leach into drinking water and cause serious health problems, including cancer, birth defects, neurological damage, immune system disorders, reproductive problems and even death. The EPA estimates that more than 100,000 people die each year in the U.S. from drinking contaminated water from coal plants. Coal ash has also been linked to a variety of other health issues, from asthma to heart disease to kidney disease. In addition to the health risks, the EPA has found that the ash poses a significant risk to groundwater and surface water, as well as to wildlife and the environment.
Duke Energy, which owns and operates the plant in Eden, N.C., is one of the nation's largest electric utilities. It is the second-largest electric utility in North Carolina, with about 1.5 million customers. According to its website, it is also the largest owner and operator of natural gas generation facilities, generating about 2.4 million megawatts of electricity. Duke has been the subject of a number of lawsuits over the years, most recently one filed by the Environmental Integrity Project (EIP), a non-profit environmental advocacy group. EIP alleges that Duke violated the Clean Water Act and other environmental laws by failing to properly treat and dispose of hazardous waste at the Eden plant.",0

.@stlouisblues are the best team in the NHL right now, and they're not even close to being done yet. — Jeff Veillette (@JeffVeillette) November 19, 2016
 the Blues have won five of their past six games, including a 3-2 shootout win over the Wild on Sunday. The Blues are on a five-game winning streak and have outscored their opponents by an average of 5.5 goals per game. They've also outshot the opposition by a wide margin, outshooting them by more than a goal a game for the first time this season. Blues captain David Backes leads the team with seven points (four goals, three assists) in his past five games. He's also tied for second on the club with four power-play goals. It's no surprise that Blues head coach Ken Hitchcock has been pleased with the way his team is playing lately. ""I think we're playing better than we've been playing for a while,"" Hitchcock said after Sunday's win, according to Mike Heika of The Associated Press (h/t NHL.com). ""We've got a lot of confidence in each other. I think that's a big part of it. We've just got to keep it going."" Blues forward Vladimir Tarasenko, who has five goals and six points in five career games against the Blackhawks, said he's been impressed with how his teammates have responded to the loss of captain Jonathan Toews (illness) and Patrick Kane (suspension) to injury. ""[Toews and Kane] are two of my best friends, so it's tough to see them go down like that, but I'm sure they'll be back soon,"" he said, per the Chicago Sun-Times' Mark Lazerus. Chicago has lost three of its past four games and is now 0-4-3 in its last seven games at United Center. Forward Patrick Sharp (lower body) is expected to miss at least two more weeks after suffering a lower-body injury in Saturday's loss to Minnesota. Coach Joel Quenneville said Sharp will be re-evaluated in two weeks and could be out as long as six weeks. Defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk (concussion) has missed the past three games with a concussion and has yet to practice this week.",0

He died of his injuries at the hospital, according to a statement from the Alexandria Police Department. The shooter, who was identified as James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, has been charged with one count of assault with a deadly weapon and two counts of discharging a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school or place of worship, the statement said. A third person was also injured in the shooting, but their injuries were not life-threatening, police said, and they were being treated for non-life threatening injuries. Police have not released the names of the victims or the shooter at this time. President Donald Trump tweeted that he was ""saddened to hear the news from Virginia"" and that ""the FBI and law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan."" The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said the president had spoken with the governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, ""to offer his thoughts and prayers for those affected by this senseless act of violence."" ""The president has also offered his condolences to the families of those who were killed and injured,"" Sanders said in a written statement. ""We will provide more information as soon as it becomes available."" Trump was scheduled to speak with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at 10:30 a.m. local time (2:00 p. m. ET) at Trump Tower in New York. Trump and his wife, Melania, had been in Japan for the G-20 summit, which was held in Hamburg, Germany, from July 7 to July 9. They will return to Washington, D.C., on July 11. White house spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump spoke with his Japanese counterpart by phone on Wednesday afternoon. Spicer did not say what the conversation was about but said it was a ""very cordial conversation."" He added that the two leaders agreed to continue to work together on issues of mutual concern, including North Korea's nuclear program and the fight against the Islamic State militant group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, in Syria and Iraq. In a tweet, Trump said he and Abe ""agreed that we must do everything in our power to help the people of France and other countries that were so badly wounded by the horrible and cowardly terrorist attack in Nice.""
The shooting was the deadliest attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001, when a truck driver plowed into a crowd of people in lower Manhattan, killing six people and injuring more than a dozen others. It also came less than two weeks after a gunman killed 58 people at an outdoor country music festival in Las Vegas, Nev., and just two days before Trump is set to meet with Russian President Vladi­mir Putin at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., for their first face-to-face meeting since Trump took office on Jan. 20. At a news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Thursday, French officials said they believed the attack was carried out by a lone gunman who acted alone and was not affiliated with any terrorist group. But they also said there was no evidence to suggest the attacker was part of any international terrorist network. France's interior minister, Gerard Collomb, told reporters that investigators were still trying to determine whether the gunman was acting on his own or was directed by someone else. French media reported that police were searching for a man in his 20s wearing a baseball cap and a hooded sweatshirt who may have been driving the vehicle that was used in Wednesday's attack.

I'm not sure what to make of this. If it's a terrorist act, then it is a terror attack, no matter what. However, if it isn't, it seems to me that there are two possibilities: 1) It was an accident. 2) There was some sort of political motive. Either way, I don't think this is the first time this has happened in this country. We've had a lot of gun control laws passed over the past few years, so I'm sure this will not be the last time something like this happens. As far as I can tell, there is no indication that this was politically motivated. This is just a tragic accident that could have easily been prevented.

The lawsuit, which was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Center for Individual Rights in Education (CIRTE) on behalf of more than 1,000 students, parents, and educators, alleges that Education Secretary Arne Duncan violated the Privacy Act of 1974 by illegally obtaining the SSNs and other personal information of over 1.5 million students from the federal government.
According to the complaint, the Education Department has been collecting and using the information for years without the knowledge or consent of the student or his or her parent or legal guardian. It also claims that Duncan has violated federal law by failing to obtain a court order to stop the collection and use of student data without a warrant or court-issued subpoena. In addition, it claims the department has failed to comply with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which requires the government to provide information on the number of requests for student information it has received and how many of those requests were granted.

The funding request comes on the heels of the Trump administration's proposed budget, which would slash the agency's budget by more than a third and eliminate its Office of Legal Counsel. The proposed cuts would result in the loss of nearly 1,000 staff positions, as well as the elimination of a number of programs, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), and NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), the groups said in a letter to Congress.
""The Trump Administration is proposing to eliminate critical programs that protect the health and well-being of millions of Americans,"" said NRDC Senior Vice President Michael Brune. ""These cuts will have a devastating impact on our nation's fish and wildlife. We urge Congress to reject these cuts and instead provide the funding needed to ensure that our fish, wildlife and habitats are protected for future generations.""",0

 the report showed that the corporation's net income fell by NT $1.2 billion, or 9.5 percent, from the same period last year.

Russia has responded by banning imports of Western foodstuffs, including beef, pork, poultry and dairy products, as well as the import of agricultural products from the EU and the United States. In response to the sanctions, Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for a ""new era"" in relations between the two countries.

The vote, which took place at the company's Charleston, S.C., plant, is expected to be certified by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) later this week. Boeing said it expects the vote to have a ""material impact"" on its financial results for the second quarter of this year. ""We are pleased with the outcome of today's vote,"" Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement. He added that the union's ""commitment to the long-term health and well-being of our employees and the communities in which they live and work is second to none."" The IAM, the world's largest industrial union, represents more than 6,000 workers at Boeing's plants in North Charleston and Everett, Wash., as well as at its commercial airplanes division in St. Louis, Mo., and its military and space divisions in Seattle, Texas and Washington. Trump has threatened to slap tariffs of as much as 45 percent on Chinese and Mexican imports in an effort to protect American jobs. In a series of tweets last week, Trump said that if Boeing did not agree to a new contract with its workers, he would impose a 35 percent tariff on all Boeing products imported into the United States from those countries. On Tuesday, Boeing announced that it had reached a tentative agreement with a union representing about 1,100 of its Boeing 777X jetliners workers that would keep the plant open through the end of the decade.",0

2683,State Rests Case In Murder Retrial Of Ex-Cincinnati Officer,"Enlarge this image toggle caption John Minchillo/AP Photo/The Cincinnati Enquirer JOHN MINCHILLI / AP PHOTO/THE CINCINNATI ENCYCLOPEDIA FILE PHOTOGRAPH BY JOHNNY M. MICHELLE MARTIN, AP WASHINGTON D.C. (AP) — A former Cincinnati police officer who was acquitted of murder charges in the shooting death of an unarmed black man will be retried for the same crime, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday. U.S. District Judge John Tunheim had found that Officer Ray Tensing did not act in self-defense when he shot and killed Samuel DuBose during a traffic stop in 2014. But the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision, finding that the trial court erred by not allowing the prosecution to introduce evidence that Tense had been drinking at the time of the incident. The court also said the evidence should have been excluded because it was not relevant to the question of whether the officer was justified in using deadly force. ""Tensing's conduct was objectively reasonable under all the circumstances,"" the court said in its opinion, which was joined by a three-judge panel from the Cincinnati-based 3rd Circuit. It added: ""The district court's decision to exclude this evidence was an abuse of discretion."" The ruling is the latest in a string of rulings that have overturned the convictions of police officers in high-profile cases, including the acquittal of former New York City Police Department officer Daniel Pantaleo, who fatally shot Eric Garner in Staten Island, N.Y., in July 2014, and the conviction of Cleveland police Officer Timothy Loehmann for fatally shooting 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland last year. In both cases the officers were found not guilty by reason of excessive force, but the appeals courts have ruled that such verdicts are not binding on the lower courts. Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac issued a statement saying he was ""disappointed"" by the ruling, adding that he will ""continue to work with our community to ensure that all of our officers are held accountable for their actions."" ""I am confident that we will prevail in this case,"" he said. Tensions between police and minority communities have increased in recent years, as police departments across the country have come under scrutiny for excessive use of force and other misconduct. Last year, the Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation into the Ferguson, Mo., police department after a grand jury decided not to indict officer Darren Wilson for shooting and killing Michael Brown, an African-American teenager, in Ferguson in August. That investigation is ongoing. A federal judge last month ordered the city of Cincinnati to pay a $5 million settlement to a man who sued the department for wrongful arrest, false imprisonment and assault after being arrested on suspicion of marijuana possession in 2010. And last week, U-T San Diego reported that a former police sergeant was sentenced to five years in federal prison after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about his role in an alleged cover-up of a police shooting that killed a mentally ill man in 2009. NPR's Robert Siegel contributed to this report. This story was produced by The Associated Press.",0

[He walks out of the room and closes the door behind him. The camera pans out to show that Chloe is now alone in her room. She looks down at her phone.] [Flashback - The scene is a flashback to when Chloe was a freshman at Blackwell Academy, where she had a crush on Nathan Prescott, who was her best friend. When she was about to tell him about her crush, she got a call from Nathan. He told her that he was going on a date with a girl named Rachel Amber, but she told him that she wasn't interested in him, so he ended the call. Later that night, Chloe and Rachel were sitting in Rachel's dorm room, talking. Rachel asked Chloe if she wanted to go to a party with her and her friends, which Chloe agreed to. At the party, Rachel told Chloe that Nathan had been cheating on her with another girl, Emily, whom he had met at school. After Chloe told Rachel about Nathan's cheating, the two of them went to Emily's room to find out what had happened. They found out that Emily and Nathan were having an affair and that they were planning to get married. Emily told them that her parents would not approve of their relationship and they had to break it off. Before they could leave, however, they heard a loud noise coming from the bathroom. As they ran to investigate, Nathan and Emily were fighting in there, with Emily trying to stop Nathan from hitting her. Nathan then told Emily to leave him alone and she did so, leaving Nathan to beat Emily up. While Emily was being beaten up, Nate came in and tried to calm her down, telling her not to let her emotions get the best of her, to which Emily responded by telling him to shut up and leave her alone. Nate then asked Emily what was wrong and when Emily said that it was nothing, he asked her what she would do if he did something like that to her again, causing her to burst into tears and run away from him.] Nate: You're not going anywhere, are you? Emily: Oh, no, not at all! I mean, if you want me to, of course I'll do anything you tell me! But I can't do that right now, because I need to talk to you about something important. What do you think? What would you say if I told you that you were the reason why I broke up with my boyfriend? Nate : I think you're the one who's the problem here, isn't she? Chloe : Yeah, that's what I was thinking too! You know, when I first met you I thought you'd be the perfect person to help me get over my ex-boyfriend, right? But then I realized that maybe you weren't the right person for me at that time either. Maybe I should have gone with someone else, or maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved in this whole thing to begin with. All I wanted was someone to love me unconditionally, someone who wouldn't judge me or make me feel like I couldn't be who I really am because of who my parents are or what my friends think of me, somebody who would be there to support me no matter how hard I try to hide my feelings from them. Then, one day you showed up at my door and told me that there was no way I could ever love someone as much as you did, even if it meant leaving you behind.",0

7477,Rubio's double-double leads Jazz to 129-99 win over Warriors,"By ANTONIO GONZALEZ and JONATHAN MURPHY
Posted Mar 07 2015 12:00AM
 the Utah Jazz are on the verge of their first back-to-back wins of the season, and they're doing it with the help of a pair of big performances from their starting backcourt. The Jazz outscored the Golden State Warriors by an average of 17.0 points in the first half of Friday night's 128-98 victory at Oracle Arena, which snapped a three-game losing streak for the Warriors. Gordon Hayward scored a season-high 31 points, Rudy Gobert added 20 and Derrick Favors added 17 off the bench to lead the Jazz, who have won four of five. ""It was a great win for us,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder told the team's official website. ""(Hayward) and (Gobert) have been playing really well. They're playing with a lot of confidence. We've got to continue to play like that."" The win was Utah's third in a row over the defending NBA champions. It was also the third time this season that Hayward has scored at least 30 points and the second time he's done it in consecutive games. He's scored 30 or more in each of his last three games, including a career-best 41 points against the Los Angeles Clippers on Feb. 25. Gober had a team-leading 20 points on 7-of-11 shooting in his first game back from a sprained left ankle. Favoring added 16 points for Utah (33-26), which has won five of six and is in position to make the playoffs for a second straight season. Utah has a game in hand on eighth-place Oklahoma City, but the Thunder are two games ahead of them with five games to go. Durant and Russell Westbrook are the only two players in NBA history to average 30.5 points per game and 10.3 assists per contest. Westbrook is averaging 31.8 points while shooting 50.2 percent from the field and 43.7 percent on 3-pointers in four games since returning from his broken left hand.
The Warriors (34-28) are in first place in their division, 2 1/2 games behind the San Antonio Spurs. Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala and Draymond Green are all averaging double figures in scoring, while David Lee and Andrew Bogut are each averaging 12.6 points. Curry is shooting 51.4 percent and has averaged 30-or-more points five times in six games this month. In the last meeting between the two teams, Curry was held to 13 points - his lowest total since Dec. 31, 2012 - in Golden state's 114-103 loss at home on Jan. 28. GoldenState has dropped three of four overall and three in overtime. That includes a 94-83 loss to Utah on Nov. 22, when Curry went scoreless for just the fourth time all season and his second-lowest total in any game since he entered the league in 2009-10. Since then, he has shot 50 percent or better in all but one game - a 99-90 win at Denver on March 2. Thompson has been a bright spot in that stretch, averaging 21.9 points over that span and shooting 53.1 percent in those contests. But he was limited to 10 points Friday, his third straight game without a field goal, as he missed all five shots he attempted and finished with nine points after scoring 21 in last month's victory over Utah. Green, meanwhile, has struggled to find his shooting touch of late, going 3 of 13 from beyond the arc over his past two matchups with Utah - both losses. However, the 6-foot-9 forward has hit a 3 or made a layup in two of those games - including Friday's game-tying 3 at the buzzer - and he scored 20 in both wins at Utah in 2014-15. NOTES: The Warriors are 2-1 on a road trip that also includes games at Houston and New Orleans.... Utah is 1-2 in its last four home games against Western Conference opponents, with its lone victory coming in December 2013 at Sacramento. --- Follow Brian Mahoney on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Briancmahoney
""I think it's just a matter of time,"" Snyder said of Hayward's return to the starting lineup, ""and we'll see how it goes."" Hayward is expected to be a limited participant in Saturday's home game against Phoenix after sitting out the previous two contests due to a strained left hamstring. Hayward will be re-evaluated after the All-Star break and could be back in action as soon as next week, according to Snyder. Snyder has said Hayward could return as early as mid-March, though he hasn't said",0

1303,Iranian official: No one will inspect our military centers,"The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said Iran had no plans to inspect its military facilities, which are under the control of the Revolutionary Guard Corps. The official also said that Iran would not allow international inspectors to visit the military sites, but would allow them to examine the facilities of its allies, including Iraq, Syria and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement. He said the inspections would be conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, and would take place over a period of several months. ""We are not going to allow any inspections,"" the official said, adding that no one would inspect Iran's nuclear facilities. Iran has repeatedly denied that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons, saying that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only and that the country has no intention of building a nuclear weapon. But the U.S. and other Western nations have accused Iran of trying to build a bomb and have imposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic in an effort to pressure it to abandon its pursuit of nuclear arms. In recent months, Iran and six world powers reached a preliminary agreement on a framework for a long-term deal that would curb Tehran's atomic program in exchange for relief from crippling economic sanctions. Under the deal, Tehran would limit its enrichment of uranium to 3.67 percent, down from its current level of 5.5 percent. It would also reduce its stockpile of enriched uranium from 20,000 kilograms to 5,060 kilograms, a drop of more than 90 percent from the stockpile at the end of last year, according to a senior Western diplomat familiar with the negotiations. A senior Iranian official told The Associated Press on Friday that Tehran had not yet decided whether it would accept the framework agreement or reject it outright. If Iran rejects the agreement, it could be forced to halt its uranium enrichment program and resume work on its heavy-water reactor at Arak, where it has been enriching uranium for the past 15 years to make fuel for its civilian nuclear power program. That reactor is believed to be capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium, although Iran says it does not have such a capability and has said it will not use the reactor for that purpose. Tehran also has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, an international waterway that connects the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean, if the international community fails to reach a deal with it over its disputed nuclear activities.
""We have not decided yet whether we will accept (the framework deal) or not,"" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast was quoted as saying by Iranian state news agency IRNA on Thursday.",0

(Mohammed Abed/AFP/Getty Images)Lebanon's Hezbollah movement said Saturday that it was holding a rally to support the Palestinian people in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, a day after the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, called for a new intifada against Israel. The rally, which is expected to draw tens of thousands of people, will take place in southern Beirut on Sunday, the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Manar TV reported, citing a statement from the movement's leadership. ""We call on our people to take to the streets to express their support for the people of Palestine,"" the statement said, according to a translation by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), a Washington-based group that monitors the conflict in Syria and other Middle Eastern countries. It added that the rally would be held at the same time as a march by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah movement in Ramallah to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1967 Six-Day War between Israel and the Arab states of Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Hezbollah has been fighting alongside the Syrian government against rebels seeking to oust President Bashar al-Assad since the uprising against his rule began in March 2011. In recent months, it has stepped up its involvement, sending fighters and weapons to bolster Assad's forces. Israel has not commented on the planned rally. But in an interview with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz published on Friday, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon said that Hezbollah was a ""terrorist organization"" and that Israel would not hesitate to respond to any threat posed by it. He also warned that any attempt by Hezbollah to carry out attacks in Israel could be met with ""unprecedented"" force.",0

He will instead run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. Bloomberg will be the first sitting mayor in the city's history to not seek a second term in office. The announcement was made at a press conference at City Hall, where he was joined by his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, and their two children. ""I'm not going to run again,"" Bloomberg said, ""because I think it's time for a new generation of leadership in this city."" Bloomberg, who has been mayor for eight years, will step down from his post at the end of the year. In a statement, Bloomberg called the decision ""the right thing to do for our city and our country."" ""It's been an honor and a privilege to serve as your mayor,"" he said in a prepared statement. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, announced his intention to seek the Republican nomination for president in 2016. Christie's announcement came as a surprise to many, as he had been rumored to be considering a presidential bid for some time. However, he has not made a final decision on whether or not to enter the race, according to his spokesman, Michael Drewniak. On the Democratic side, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is expected to announce her presidential candidacy in early 2015. Clinton, the former first lady, senator and secretary of state, is widely considered the front-runner to win the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. Former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley and former Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee have also been mentioned as possible presidential candidates, but have not officially announced their candidacies. *New York Daily News: ""NYC Mayor: I'm Not Running for Senate"" <http://www.nydailynews.co.uk/news/national/nyc-mayor-i-m-not-running-for-senate-article-1.262909>* By Michael Barbaro February 14, 2014, 12:00 p.m. EST Mayor Bill de Blasio said he is not running to become the next senator from the Empire State.

Asked by Kramer if he thought he could win a statewide election, DeBlasio said ""No, I don't think so."" He added that his decision to leave the mayor's office was a ""mutual decision"" and that it was ""not a decision that I made lightly."" The mayor also said that while he did not want to talk about his political future at this point, it is ""certainly something that's on my mind."" Asked about the possibility of a possible run against President Barack Obama, which he called ""a very real possibility,"" Deblasio declined to comment, saying that ""it's not something I've thought about at all."" *Associated Press: ""'I've been thinking about it'"": New Yorkers react to Mayor Bloomberg leaving office <https://bigstory.ap.org/article/d7e9c5a9e4b4c0f8c9f9d8e7a7b9b7/new-yorks-responds-to-nypd-presidential-candidate-billy-christie-in-newspaper-interview> // AP // Julie Bykowicz – Feb. 13, 2015* NEW YORK CITY (AP) — The reaction to the sudden departure of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani from politics was swift and furious on social media Wednesday, with some calling for him to return to public life and others saying he should stay out of politics altogether. But Giuliani's supporters said they were not surprised by the news, given his long career in public service and his reputation for being a tough, no-nonsense mayor who was not afraid to take on the powerful and powerful interests in his city. And they said his departure was the result of his own decision, not that of any outside force, such as the White House or Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign, that was trying to get him back into the political fray. It was also not a sign that Giuliani was about to endorse any particular candidate, some of whom have been making the rounds in recent days to try to drum up support for their own presidential bids.

6:20 p.m.
, June 15: President Donald Trump says he is ""saddened and angry"" by the attack on a congressional baseball team that left three people dead and several others injured. He says the U.S. is at war with ""radical Islamic terrorism"" and that ""we must be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights as Americans, and the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety for the citizens of our country."" He adds: ""We must not allow ISIS to return, or enter, our Country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere. If we don't get tough and smart very quickly, we are not going to have a country left to speak of in a very, very short period of time. Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess!""

Posted by: Ace at 06:00 PMThe latest news from Baton Rouge, La. on Sunday, July 14:
Baton Rouge Police Chief Carl Dabadie Jr. says a suspect has been taken into custody in connection with a shooting at the Republican Congressional Baseball Game at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. Police say the suspect, identified as James T. Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Ill., was shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer after he fired on officers with an AR-15-style rifle. A law enforcement official tells The Associated Press that the shooter was a 66-year-old Illinois man who had a lengthy history of mental illness and had been hospitalized several times in recent years for mental health issues, including one episode in which he threatened to kill himself and his wife. ""It's a terrible tragedy,"" said Rep. Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana Democrat who represents the district where the baseball game is being played. Richmond said he had spoken with the congressman's wife, who told him that her husband had recently been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and was taking medication for it. But he said it was too soon to know whether the incident was related to his mental-health issues or whether it had anything to do with his political views or his views on gun control. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe has declared a state of emergency in Virginia's 10th Congressional District, which includes parts of Alexandria and Alexandria's suburbs. McAuliffe said Sunday that he has asked the state's National Guard to deploy to help with security and recovery efforts. Washington Mayor Muriel E. Bowser said she was praying for those who were injured and for ""all of those affected by this senseless violence."" ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to all those involved in this tragic event,"" she said, adding that she and other city leaders have been in touch with congressional leaders and are ""working closely with them to ensure the safety and security of all our residents and visitors."" She also said her office is working with state and local officials to ""ensure that all necessary resources are in place to provide the best possible support to our city's residents, visitors and employees."". @RepCedricRichmond: Our thoughts & prayers are w/ those injured & their loved ones in #Alexandria, VA.

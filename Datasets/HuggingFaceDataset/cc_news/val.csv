7885,New device promises to dissolve fat without surgery,"A new device developed by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of obesity, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). The device, which is currently being tested in a clinical trial, is the first of its kind to deliver a drug directly to the body's fat cells, bypassing the need for surgery.
""This is a very exciting development,"" said study co-author and UCSF associate professor of medicine, Dr. Robert Lustig, who is also a senior investigator at Stanford University's Center for Translational Medicine. ""We've been working on this for a long time, and now we have a device that can deliver drugs directly into the fat tissue of obese patients. This could be a game-changer for obesity treatment, because it will allow patients to lose weight without having to go under the knife. It could also be used to treat other diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease, that are associated with excess body fat, as well as obesity itself.""",0

The defendant, Steven A. Cohen, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and two counts of wire fraud. He was sentenced today in Manhattan federal court.
According to the indictment, Cohen and his co-conspirators, including a former Goldman Sachs employee, created and executed a series of trades designed to manipulate the price of a company's stock in order to gain an unfair advantage over other investors in the company. These trades, which were executed on behalf of the firm, were intended to artificially inflate the value of Goldman's own stock, thereby making it appear more valuable than it actually was. As a result, Goldman was able to increase its market capitalization by more than $2.5 billion in less than two years, while its competitors were forced to sell their stocks at a loss. In total, this scheme resulted in losses to Goldman of approximately $900 million, as well as the disgorgement of over $800 million in profits to its investors.

(Photo: IDF Spokesperson's Unit)In the past few months, the Israeli army has seized more than 1,000 illegal weapons, including machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades, and mortars, according to data obtained by The Electronic Intifada through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA). The weapons were seized during the course of the 2014 Gaza war, during which Israel killed over 2,100 Palestinians and injured over 4,500.
, which was launched in response to rocket fire from Gaza into southern Israel. The operation was intended to destroy the tunnels used by Hamas to smuggle weapons into the Gaza Strip, as well as to prevent the smuggling of weapons from the West Bank into Gaza. During the operation, Israeli forces also seized a number of rocket launchers and other weapons that were destined for Hamas. According to a report by Israel's Channel 2 News, ""The IDF has confiscated more weapons than in any other operation since the beginning of Operation Pillar of Defense in November 2012."" The report also noted that ""the IDF confiscated a total of 1.5 tons of explosives, 1 ton of mortar shells, 2.2 tons [of] rockets, 3.4 tons (of) ammunition, 4.8 tons, of machine-guns, 5.6 tons and more of ammunition."" In addition to these weapons seizures, IDF forces have also arrested hundreds of Hamas operatives, many of whom are believed to have been involved in smuggling weapons and ammunition into Hamas-controlled territory.According to IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, in 2014, Israel seized ""more than 500 weapons,"" including ""machine guns,"" ""rocket launchers,"" and ""mortar shells."" Lerner also said that the army ""seized a large number"" of rockets and mortar rounds.In addition, Lerner added that Israel has arrested ""several hundred"" Hamas members in connection with the illegal arms trade. ""We have arrested several hundred people,"" he said, adding that these arrests were made ""in the last few weeks.""In an interview with The Times of Israel, a senior IDF officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, told the paper: ""There is no doubt in my mind that there is a lot of smuggling going on in Gaza."" He added, however, that he did not know how many weapons had been seized, or how they were being used.The Israeli military has not released the names of any of those arrested, nor has it released any information about how the weapons are being seized. However, it is known that some of them are suspected of having been used in attacks on Israeli civilians. In one case, for example, an Israeli soldier was killed by a mortar shell that was fired from a Gaza-bound vehicle, while in another case a Hamas operative was shot dead by an IDF sniper while attempting to flee the scene of an attack in which he had fired a rocket at Israeli soldiers.",0

4254,More than spectacle: Eclipses create science and so can you,".Eclipsing the sun is one of the most awe-inspiring events in the solar system. The sun's corona, the outermost layer of its atmosphere, is so bright that it can be seen with the naked eye from Earth. But it's not just a sight to behold. It's also an opportunity to learn more about our home planet and the universe in general. And that's exactly what NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) has been doing for more than a decade.
The sun has an enormous magnetic field that protects it from solar wind, a stream of charged particles that can damage satellites and interfere with radio and television signals. SDO, however, can detect and track these particles, allowing scientists to study them in greater detail than ever before. In fact, it was the first space observatory to be able to observe the coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that are responsible for most of Earth's space weather, including solar flares, solar storms, and geomagnetic storms. By studying these events, scientists hope to gain a better understanding of what causes them and how to prevent them from happening again.",0

 the Predators (14-4-2) are now on a five-game winning streak, the longest in the NHL this season. They have outscored their opponents 16-5 during the streak. Nashville has won its last four games against the Buffalo Sabres (7-9-3), including a 3:1 victory on Dec. 5. the Preds have been outshot in three of those four wins, but they've out-possessed the Sabres by an average of 3.5 to 1. Buffalo has scored just one goal in those three games, and has been held to one or fewer shots in all but one of them. ""We've got to get back to playing the way we know how to play,"" said Predators defenseman P.K. Subban, who had a goal and an assist in Saturday's win over the New York Islanders. ""If we do that, we're going to be a tough team to beat. We've been playing good hockey lately and we need to keep it going."" Nashville will try to continue its recent success against a Sabres team that has lost four of five and is in danger of missing the playoffs for just the second time since 2009-10. Sabres coach Dan Bylsma said the team needs to find a way to win games when they're down a man, something it hasn't been able to do in recent weeks. He also said he's concerned about the health of defenseman Rasmus Ristolainen (upper body) and forward Evander Kane (lower body), both of whom are day-to-day. Kane has missed the last two games with a lower-body injury and was a late scratch on Saturday. R",0

A federal appeals court has ruled that a former UNC football player who was accused of sexually assaulting a female student should be allowed to graduate from the school despite the fact that he was investigated by the university's Title IX office and found guilty of sexual assault. The ruling by a three-judge panel at the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., is the latest in a string of victories for the accused student, who is now pursuing a lawsuit against UNC for violating his due-process rights and for failing to provide him with an opportunity to defend himself against the allegations.
... The case began in 2012, when the woman accused the former player of raping her in his dorm room in the fall of 2011. She said she woke up to find him on top of her, with his hands down her pants and his tongue in her mouth, according to court documents. When she told him to stop, he allegedly said, ""I'm going to kill you."" The woman reported the incident to UNC's Office of Student Conduct, which investigated the case and determined that the alleged assault did not meet the legal definition of rape under the federal law that governs campus sexual assaults. But the investigation was closed without a finding of guilt, and the accuser was not informed of any disciplinary action taken against her alleged assailant. Instead, she was told that she would have to sit out the next semester while she waited for her case to be adjudicated. In the meantime, the man she accused continued to play on the football team, earning a scholarship to attend UNC, where he graduated in May 2013 with a degree in business administration. He was later hired as an assistant football coach, but was fired after a video surfaced in which he appeared to make disparaging comments about women, including one woman who accused him of groping her and another who said he kissed her without her consent. After the video was released, UNC President Margaret Spellings announced that all football players would be required to undergo mandatory sexual-assault training and be subject to a ""zero-tolerance"" policy for sexual misconduct. A year later, in January 2014, a federal grand jury indicted the player on two counts of aggravated sexual battery and one count of simple assault, all of which were related to the 2012 incident. According to an affidavit filed in support of a search warrant that led to his arrest, prosecutors said that during the course of their investigation, they learned that ""the defendant had engaged in sexual activity with the complainant on multiple occasions,"" including at a fraternity party and at his home. They also said they found text messages between the two of them that were ""consistent with consensual sexual conduct."" In a statement to The Washington Post, an attorney for UNC said it was ""disappointed"" by Thursday's ruling. ""The university is committed to providing a safe and supportive learning environment for all students,"" the statement said. It added: ""We will continue to vigorously defend the rights of our student-athletes and their families to participate in and benefit from all aspects of campus life. We are confident that we will prevail in this matter."" UNC has not responded to NPR's request for comment.",0

2117,Program perkongsian kereta elektrik dirasmikan dengan 80 kereta," ekonomiska kontaktivitet.The perkong is the most important part of the game. It determines how much damage you do to enemies, how many times you can kill them, and how long it takes you to get back to your base. The perk is divided into two parts: the base damage and the bonus damage. Base damage refers to the amount of damage done to an enemy when you hit them with a melee attack. For example, if you have a perk that increases your melee damage by 10%, you will do 10% more damage with melee attacks than you would normally do. Bonus damage is determined by the number of times the enemy has been hit by an attack in the last 10 seconds. This is calculated by taking the average of all the hits that have been made by that enemy in that 10-second period. In other words, the more hits you make in a 10 second period, then the higher your bonus will be. If you are using a weapon that has a high bonus, such as a greatsword, you may want to consider using this perk to increase the damage of your attacks. However, it is not necessary to do so, as the perk will increase your damage regardless of whether you use a sword or a mace.
Skills and Perks [ edit | edit source ] The following skills and perks are available to you at level 1: Archery: Increases your chance to hit with ranged attacks by 5%.
. Marksman: Reduces the time required to reload your crossbow by 0.5 seconds and increases the reload speed of crossbows by 1.0 seconds per level. Sneak: Sneak is your primary means of getting around. You gain a +5% bonus to sneak attack damage for each level in this skill, up to a maximum bonus of +10%. Survival: You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, stunned, or knocked unconscious. Unarmed: Your unarmed strikes deal an additional 1d6 damage on a successful hit. Two-Weapon Fighting: When you engage in two-weapon fighting, add half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) to damage rolls with one weapon and you take no damage from the other. One-Handed: While wielding a one-handed weapon in one hand and no other weapons, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + 1/2 your Strength modifier. Ranged Weapon Proficiency: At 1st level you gain proficiency with the longbow and shortbow. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, this proficiency increases by +1. Survival Expertise: Once per short rest, when a creature within 30 feet of you makes an Intelligence (Survival) check to track you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, they become frightened for 1 minute. A creature that succeeds on the save is immune to this effect for 24 hours. Additionally, once per long rest when using the Survival skill to follow a scent trail, creatures that fail their Wisdom (Perception) save are blinded until the end of their next turn. Weapon Training: As a bonus action, choose one type of weapon. Until the start of each of its turns, whenever you attack with that weapon, its damage die becomes a d8 and its critical multiplier is doubled (to a minimum of 2d8). You can use this feature twice before needing to take an action to use it again. Hunter's Mark: Starting at 2nd level, a hunter's mark can be placed on any creature you see within 60 feet. That creature can't be targeted by spells or other magical effects, but it can still be affected by non-magical attacks and effects that target only one creature. When the mark is placed, any attack roll made against the target by you or an ally that can see or hear you is made with advantage if the attack is against an invisible creature or one that isn't incapacitated. While the creature is under the effect of this mark, their speed is halved and they have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and ability checks made to hide or hide in plain sight. They can also use their reaction to attempt to escape from an effect that would force them to move or take actions that require a movement action (such as being grappled, knocked prone, restrained, etc.). This effect lasts for a number or rounds equal to 3 times your hunter level (minimum of 1). The hunter can only have one hunter mark active at a time. Once the hunter has placed their mark it cannot be removed by any means, including the use of a remove curse or remove disease spell. Marked creatures do not gain the benefits of any other hunter marks they may have, nor do they gain any benefits from any hunter",0

4128,Student Gets Missing Wallet Returned 4 Years Later,"Enlarge this image toggle caption Eric Risberg/AFP/Getty Images/Ikon Images for The New York Times/Redux/Epa-Efe/Corbis via Getty Images Erica Ristenparte, a 19-year-old student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, was last seen in the early morning hours of Sept. 11, 2001, when she left her dorm room to go to class. She was never heard from again. Her wallet was found four years later in a trash can in her apartment building. It contained her driver's license, student ID card and a $20 bill. The wallet also contained a note that read, ""I love you."" The note was signed by a man who identified himself as her boyfriend. He said he was going to meet her the next day to pick her up. But he never showed up, and no one has seen him since. His family has filed a missing person's report with the police, but no arrests have been made. Erica's family says they are still searching for answers about what happened to her. ""It's been a long time since we've seen her,"" says her father, Robert. Robert says his daughter was a good student and had a bright future ahead of her — but she never made it out of the dorms alive that day. Now, he says, she's just a ""ghost"" in his family's life. In the years since her disappearance, the case has become a cause célèbre among conspiracy theorists, who believe that the U.S. government orchestrated the attack on the World Trade Center in order to justify the invasion of Afghanistan and the war in Iraq. They say the 9/11 attacks were an inside job, carried out by the Bush administration and its allies, including the Saudi royal family. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that she was killed by her own government, or that her body was buried in an effort to cover up the truth of what really happened on that fateful day in 2001. And now, her family is trying to figure out what to do with their daughter's missing wallet, which they say has been in their family for years and has never been seen by anyone but their son and daughter-in-law. On a recent visit to the family home, I met with Robert and his wife, Susan, at their home in San Diego, where they have lived for the past 20 years. Susan says she and her husband have never given up hope that Erica will be found alive and well — and that they will never give up on finding her killer or killers. I asked Susan if she thought it was possible that someone could have killed her daughter and then buried the wallet in hopes that it would never be seen again? ""Absolutely,"" she said. When asked what she would say to anyone who might be interested in learning more about Erica and why her wallet is so important to them, they both said the same thing: ""We want to know who did this to our daughter. We don't want anyone else to have to suffer the way we have."" Susan said she believes that whoever killed Erica is still out there, waiting for someone to come forward with information that will lead to an arrest and conviction in this case. If you have any information about her case, you're asked to call the San Francisco Police Department at (415) 575-4444. You can also send an anonymous tip by calling the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children at 1-800-THE-LOST or by texting TIP411 to CRIMES (274637) on your cell phone. A reward of up to $10,000 is being offered for information leading to a conviction. For more information, visit www.nationalcenterformissingkids.org.",0

The court also ordered that he be barred from holding public office for five years, according to a copy of the court order obtained by Reuters. A spokesman for the Pakistani government could not immediately be reached for comment on the disqualification.

124,Trump order would target high skilled worker visa program,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Friday that would cut off federal funding to so-called ""sanctuary cities"" that do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities.

It also calls for the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and the hiring of 5,000 more Border Patrol agents. Trump's order is expected to be challenged in court, but the White House has said it is not a ""Muslim ban"" and will not bar people from certain Muslim-majority countries from entering the country. Read more: http://abcn.ws/2fBXzYh
The order also directs DHS to develop a list of cities and counties that are ""unwilling or unable"" to assist federal authorities with immigration enforcement, and instructs the secretary of homeland security to report back to the president within 90 days on the progress of those efforts. ""The Secretary shall take all appropriate actions, including the use of all available law enforcement and prosecutorial resources, to identify and arrest and prosecute any officer, employee, or agent of any State, local, tribal or foreign government who willfully violates any provision of this order or the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder,"" the document states. In a statement, DHS Secretary John Kelly said the administration is ""committed to protecting the American people and upholding the rule of law."" ""We are also committed to working with all relevant federal, state and local partners to protect the safety and security of our communities,"" he said. A federal judge in New York issued a temporary restraining order Friday blocking the Trump administration from deporting people who were brought to this country illegally as children or who have been convicted of serious crimes, such as murder, sexual assault or drug trafficking. That order was put on hold by a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., after the Justice Department asked the court to stay the ruling while the government appeals the decision. But the judge said she would issue a permanent injunction if the federal government does not comply by June 5 with a court order to stop the deportations of people with criminal records who are being held at the nation's busiest immigration detention center in Texas, known as the Rio Grande Valley Detention Facility (RGVDF). The judge's ruling came after a lawsuit was filed by the ACLU, the National Immigration Law Center (NILC), the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) and several other groups. They argued that the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allows some undocumented immigrants who arrived as minors to apply for a two-year reprieve from deportation, violates the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law, as well as federal law that prohibits discrimination based on national origin or religion. Judge Ann Donnelly, a George W. Bush appointee, said in her ruling that ""the government has failed to show that it has a compelling interest in maintaining the status quo."" She also said there was ""no evidence that any of these individuals would pose a threat to national security or public safety.""

The rule would apply to all workplaces in the United States, including those that are not covered by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, or marital status. OSHA is proposing the rule in response to a series of high-profile incidents in which transgender people have been harassed or assaulted in restrooms, locker rooms, showers, and other areas of workplaces. These incidents have prompted a number of states and local governments to pass laws that prohibit discrimination in these areas. In addition, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have issued guidance to employers on how to comply with these laws and to ensure that transgender employees are treated with dignity and respect.
""We are committed to ensuring that all Americans have the opportunity to work and live in a safe and healthy workplace, free from discrimination and harassment,"" said Lisa Farbstein, acting assistant administrator for the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP). ""This rule will help protect the health and safety of our nation's workers and their families, while also protecting the privacy and dignity of transgender individuals.""... The NPRM will be published for public comment for 90 days and is expected to be finalized by the end of 2016.

The Mets beat the Cubs for the second time in three years, 10-9, on Tuesday night in Game 6 of the National League Championship Series.

The Mets (71-55) won their second straight NL East title with a 3-2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Monday night at Citi Field. It was the team's first division title since 2011. They also won the NL wild-card game and clinched the No. 1 wild card spot with Monday's win. ""It's been a long time coming,"" said Murphy, who hit the game-tying homer off Cardinals starter Adam Wainwright with two on and one out in his first at-bat. He added an RBI double and a run-scoring single. Mets manager Terry Collins said he was pleased with how his team responded to the Cardinals' late rally, which included a two-out, bases-loaded walk to Carlos Beltran and an error by Cardinals shortstop Jhonny Peralta that allowed Murphy to score from second base on a wild pitch. Collins also said it was a good sign that Murphy was able to get on base with runners on first and second with no outs, as he had not done in any of his previous three postseason games. Murphy's homer was his second in as many games, and he became the first Mets player to reach the 300-homer mark in back-to-back games since Curtis Granderson did it in 2010 and '11, when he hit four homers in two games against the Los Angeles Dodgers. After a scoreless first inning, Murphy went 3 for 4 with three RBIs and two runs scored, including the go-ahead RBI single that tied it at 2. With the bases loaded, he singled to right field and scored on an infield single by Lucas Duda to make it 6-3. In the sixth, the left-hander struck out the side to end the threat of a Cardinals comeback, but he allowed a leadoff single to Dexter Fowler and then a sacrifice fly by Matt Carpenter to put runners at second and third with nobody out. That's when Murphy stepped up, striking out pinch-runner Daniel Descalso on four pitches and scoring the tying run on his third homer in four games to tie the score at 7-7. Dickey (1-1) gave up three runs and seven hits in 5 2/3 innings, giving up five hits and three walks while walking one and strikingout three. His ERA is the lowest for a Mets pitcher since his rookie season in 2008, according to STATS LLC, while his WHIP (0.96) is also his lowest since that season and his strikeout to walk ratio is his worst since he joined the rotation in 2013. Deschamps (3-5) allowed four runs in 6 1⁄ 3 innings and walked four and hit one batter.",0

""I'm not saying it's fraud, but I'm saying there's a lot of potential for fraud,"" said the researcher who goes by the name of ""VoterFraud."" ""If you look at some of these records, you can see that there are people who have voted in multiple states."" The records were found on a website called ""voterfraud.org,"" which is run by a group called True the Vote. They say they are a non-partisan organization that is dedicated to ""fighting for the integrity of our elections."" They also say their mission is to ensure that all eligible voters have an opportunity to cast a ballot in an election. But the group has been under fire for its tactics, which include voter intimidation and voter suppression. A number of lawsuits have been filed against them, including one filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., in which a federal judge ruled that they violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the National Voter Registration Act.",0

The North's state-run KCNA news agency said on Saturday that the US was behind the hacking attacks, which it said were aimed at disrupting the country's nuclear and missile programmes.

 the North said the cyber attacks had been carried by ""the CIA"" and ""NSA"", referring to the intelligence agencies of the two countries. It did not give any further details about the source of its information. The US has not commented on the claims, but has previously said it was not responsible for cyber-attacks against North Korean targets. ""We do not comment on intelligence matters,"" White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Friday., a spokesman for South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS), told Yonhap News Agency on Sunday that he could not confirm or deny the report. He said he had no information on whether the NIS was involved in the alleged hacking, adding that it would be inappropriate for him to comment further.The South Korean intelligence agency has been investigating the possible involvement of a group of hackers known as the ""Guardians of Peace"" (GOP), which has claimed responsibility for hacking into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Sony Pictures Entertainment (SCE) in recent months.On Friday, the GOP claimed to have hacked into Sony's computer systems and released a trove of data, including emails and internal documents, in an apparent attempt to influence the presidential election in favor of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.North Korean state media has also claimed that US President Donald Trump had ordered a cyberattack against Pyongyang in retaliation for its nuclear test in September.Pyongyang has repeatedly threatened to destroy the South and its US ally if it were to attack it.",0

They will also discuss ways to improve relations between the United States and Russia, which have been strained since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and supported pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. In addition, they will discuss the situation in Syria and how to resolve the Syrian civil war, with a focus on the role of Russia in that conflict. Trump and Putin will meet for the second time at the G-20 summit of world leaders in Germany in early September.
Putin and Trump will hold a joint press conference following the summit, during which the Russian president will address the press and answer questions from the media.

2447,MKs make a surprise visit to the Abu-Kabir detention center,", where they are met by a group of young men who are being held in the same facility.""We are here to help you,"" one of them says. ""We have been waiting for you for a long time, and we want to see you again. We want you to come back to us and tell us what happened to you. Tell us how you were tortured and what you did to your family and friends,"" he says, pointing to a young man who is sitting on the floor with his hands cuffed behind his back. The man's face is covered with a bandage, but his eyes are open and he appears to be listening intently to what is being said to him. He is wearing a black T-shirt with the words ""I am a prisoner"" written on it and a pair of blue jeans. His hands are bound behind him and his feet are shackled together. Another detainee, a man in his mid-twenties, sits on a bench next to them, his face covered in bandages. A third man, who looks like a middle-aged man with short black hair and glasses, is standing nearby. All three of these men are in their late teens or early twenties. They are all wearing black hoods over their faces and have their hands tied behind their backs. One of the detainees asks the other two if they know who he is, to which they reply, ""No, we don't know him."" The detainee then asks if he can speak to his family, which the two men reply that they do not know where he lives. After a few moments of silence, the detainee says that he wants to tell them about the torture he suffered at the hands of his captors and how he was forced to eat his own excrement and urinate on himself in order to survive. This is the first time he has spoken to anyone about what he went through during his time in detention. At this point, another detainee approaches the group and asks them what they think of this detainee's story. In response to this question, all three detainees turn to look at one another and say that this man is lying. As the man continues to speak, he begins to tear up and cries out in pain, as if his body is trying to break free from the shackles that are holding it in place. Finally, after several more minutes of questioning, they decide to let him go, saying that it is not safe for him to stay in this facility any longer. When they return to their cell, one detainee tells his fellow detainees that there is a new detainee who has come to visit them and ask for their help in finding a way to get out of Abu Kabir. It turns out that the person who came to ask them for help is none other than Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of ISIS in Iraq and the self-proclaimed caliph of all Muslims. Baghdadi is accompanied by several other ISIS members, including a woman who wears a headscarf that covers her entire face. She is dressed in black and has long, dark hair that is tied back in a ponytail that reaches down to her waist. Her eyes and mouth are covered and she has a tattoo on her left arm that reads ""Kuffar"" (non-believer). The woman tells the men that she is from Mosul and that her family was killed by ISIS when they tried to flee the city during the Iraqi army's offensive to retake it from ISIS earlier this year. Before she can finish her story, however, she gets interrupted by the arrival of two other detainees, both of whom are wearing white jumpsuits that cover their entire bodies except for the tops of their feet and ankles. These two detainees are also wearing hooded sweatshirts and are carrying large black bags that appear to contain large quantities of food and other supplies. Both detainees tell the others that their families are still alive in Mosul, although they have not been able to contact them since ISIS took over Mosul in June 2014. Their families were killed when ISIS fighters stormed their homes and took them as prisoners of war. According to these detainees' accounts, their family members were taken to an unknown location and then executed in cold blood, with their throats slit and their bodies thrown into the Euphrates River. ISIS has claimed responsibility for these killings, claiming that these people were ""collaborators"" with Iraqi security forces. However, it has also been reported that ISIS executed many of its own members during this period of time as well, such as a number of women and children who were reportedly executed for refusing to convert to Islam or for not wearing the niqab (face veil). In any case, ISIS is known to have executed thousands of people during its reign of terror in Syria and Iraq over the past several years. Many of those executed were accused of collaborating with Syrian government forces,",0

913,Greens push for broader copyright ‘safe harbour’ provisions,"The Australian Greens have called on the Federal Government to introduce a broader safe harbour scheme for online copyright infringement, which they say would protect the rights of online service providers from liability for copyright infringements committed by their users.
In a submission to the Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2015, the Greens say that the current safe harbor scheme is too narrow, and that it does not adequately address the needs of the online industry. The Greens also argue that there is a lack of clarity around what constitutes an infringement of copyright by a user of a service provider's website, or by an individual user accessing a website from a third party's computer or mobile device. They also point out that existing safe harbors do not provide adequate protection for users of services providers' websites from being held liable for the actions of third parties who use their services. This is particularly the case when it comes to online services that allow users to upload and share copyrighted content, such as music, movies, television shows, software and software applications, as well as websites that host such content. In these cases, it is the user's responsibility to ensure that their content is not being used in a way that infringes the copyright owner's rights. For example, if a person uploads a song to a music website and then shares it with a friend, that person is responsible for that friend's use of that song, even if the song was not created by the person who uploaded it. However, in cases where users upload content to websites hosted on third-party computers and mobile devices, they may not be held responsible if their actions infringe on copyright owners' rights, because they are not directly involved in creating the content or distributing it to others. As a result, users are often not aware that they have infringed copyright when they share content on a site hosted by someone else. Furthermore, there are no provisions in existing copyright law to protect users from having their online activities monitored by copyright holders, who may be able to use the information they gather about their activities to pursue legal action against them. These issues are particularly relevant in the digital world, where the vast majority of internet users access the internet through a computer, mobile phone or tablet, rather than a desktop or laptop computer. It is also important to note that, under current law, a copyright holder can seek a court order to monitor the activities of an internet user, regardless of whether or not that user is actually infringing copyright. Under the Safe Harbour scheme, this would be possible, but it would require the court to first obtain a warrant from the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), which would then have to be approved by both the Attorney-General and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade before it could be carried out. There are also concerns about the extent to which the ACMA would have the power to carry out such an order, given its role as a regulator of telecommunications services and internet services in Australia. A number of other countries, including the United Kingdom and New Zealand, have introduced legislation that would provide greater protection to users who upload copyright-infringing material to their websites. While these countries have not yet implemented the legislation in full, some have already made significant progress in this area, while others have yet to do so. Australia is currently the only G20 country without such a scheme in place.",0

(AP Photo/Mohammad Ismail) (Photo: The Associated Press) Story Highlights The Taliban has claimed responsibility for a series of deadly attacks in Afghanistan this year.
Kerry says the United States will continue to work with the Afghan government to bring peace to the war-ravaged country. He also says he is confident the Taliban will not be able to take control of Afghanistan's government and military in the near future, as they have done in neighboring Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir, or P.K.-K.A.P. The U.N. Security Council is expected to hold an emergency meeting on Monday to discuss the attacks that have killed more than 100 people and wounded hundreds more. Kerry says there is no justification for such attacks and that those responsible must be brought to justice. ""This is an attack on all of us. It's an assault on our way of life,"" Kerry said in a statement released by the State Department. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1bKlwQa",0

They're devaluing their currency and many other countries are doing the same thing. You look at what China is doing to us with their intellectual property theft and everything else, we have a trade deficit with China of $350 billion a year. That's more than any other country in the world and yet we're not allowed to use our own money to negotiate a fair trade deal for our workers and our companies. So we'll start renegotiating on day one, day two, or day three, I don't know. But I will tell you this: We will start negotiating on behalf of the American worker and not for the special interests and the lobbyists and everybody else that has been taking advantage of us for many, many years.

I was in favor of going into Iraq, but the fact is that we destabilized the Middle East. ISIS formed with the help of Saddam Hussein. He was a bad guy, by the way, right? But when we got out, what did we get? We got nothing. Iraq is now a breeding ground for terrorism. Iran is taking over huge portions of that country. Libya is a disaster. Syria is worse than it was even before our very, very stupid leadership allowed it to happen. Now, you can say, 'Well, maybe Assad should do it.' But you know what? He's using chemical weapons against his own people. There's a whole thing going on that our leadership doesn't get it, which is very sad. Our leadership is all talk and no action. All talk, no results. When will this end? It will end when our leaders figure out that it is time to get tough, when they realize that the United States can no longer be the policeman of a world that is badly in need of it.

U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves ruled that the law, which was passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature and signed into law by Republican Gov. Phil Bryant, violates the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech and the right to free exercise of religion. The law also requires abortion clinics to meet the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers and requires doctors who perform the procedure to be certified by a medical board that is not affiliated with the Mississippi Medical Association, Reeves wrote in his ruling on Monday. He also said the requirement that doctors be able to provide abortion care within a 30-mile radius of their clinic violates a provision in the federal Family Medical Leave Act that allows employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a newborn or a seriously ill family member. Reeves said he would issue a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of those provisions. A hearing on the injunction is scheduled for Wednesday. ""This is a major victory for women's health and safety,"" said Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, in a statement. She called the ruling ""an important step toward ensuring that Mississippi women have access to safe and legal abortion services."" The lawsuit was brought by Mississippi Right to Life and Mississippi Alliance for Life, both of which are based in Jackson, Mississippi. Both groups said they would appeal the judge's ruling to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, where the case is being heard. In addition to Reeves, the court also heard arguments from attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi and a coalition of abortion rights groups, including NARAL Pro-Choice America and National Advocates for Pregnant Women, as well as the Center for Reproductive Rights.",0

5:30 p.m.
. The White House says the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in a lawsuit challenging the president's ban on travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. It's the first time the high court has heard arguments on the issue since the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the ban in late February, saying it violated the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law. Trump has said the travel ban is needed to protect the country from terrorism, but critics say it's a thinly veiled attempt to restrict Muslims from entering the United States. A federal judge in Seattle issued a nationwide temporary restraining order against the order in March, and a federal appeals court in San Francisco is considering whether to take up the case. In a statement, the Trump administration says it will ""vigorously defend"" its order and ""will continue to enforce the nation's immigration laws to ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles."" The president says he's ""very disappointed"" in the court's ruling, calling it a ""disgrace to our country and to the rule of law."" He says his order is ""not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion — this is about terror and keeping our nation safe."" Trump says, ""We are fighting hard for Merrick Garland, who I consider to be a very, very great man. I have great respect for the fact that he is being treated so unfairly by the Democrats. We'll see what happens with that. But we're going to continue our fight for him and for everybody else that's been affected by this horrible order that was put in place by a judge that is totally against us, against everything we are all about as Americans.""

The Celtics rallied from a 17-point deficit in Game 1 to beat the Bucks 91-86 on Wednesday night, and they'll need to do it again Thursday night to advance to the Western Conference Finals for the second time in three years. ""It's a great feeling,"" said Avery Bradley, who scored a game-high 22 points.
.@BostonCeltics' Avery Bradley scores 22 to lead Celtics past @MilwaukeeBucks. #NBAFinals — NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) March 3, 2014 Boston led by as many as 17 points in a first half in which they outscored Milwaukee 31-14.

2318,Palestinian Authority preparing to 'disengage' from Israel,"JERUSALEM (Ma'an) 23 Jan — The Palestinian Authority is preparing ""to disengage"" from the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, a senior Palestinian official said Monday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said that the PA is in the process of setting up an office in Ramallah to oversee the disengagement process. He said the office is expected to be operational by the end of this month. ""We are preparing for the withdrawal of our forces from Gaza and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state,"" the official told Ma'ansat, the Palestinian news agency, adding that ""we are ready to withdraw from all the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, and to establish the state of Palestine in all of its parts."" He did not elaborate on how the Palestinians would achieve this goal. Palestinian officials have repeatedly said they will not recognize Israel as a Jewish state and have called for a ""two-state solution"" that would see the creation of two states for two peoples — one Jewish and one Arab — in peace and security. However, in recent months, Palestinian leaders have made it clear that they do not want to see an end to Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory, which has been in place since the 1967 Six-Day War. Last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not negotiate with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas over the issue of Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land.",0

2008,Aneka acara bagi murid prasekolah,".(I am the mother of a beautiful girl. She is very beautiful. I want to give her to you. But I am afraid that if I do so, you will not be able to bear her. So I beg you, please do not take her away from me. If you do, I will never forgive you.)
Prayer to the Mother of the Bridegroom: I pray that the Lord will bless you with a son, and that he will be a good man and a faithful husband. May he be kind to his wife and faithful to her children. He will love them with all his heart and may they be happy in his presence. (This prayer is to be recited at the time of marriage, when the bride and groom are about to consummate their marriage. It is also said after the marriage has been consummated and before the wedding is solemnized. The words are as follows: ""I pray for you and for your husband, that you may be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over all the fish in the sea and over every living thing that moveth upon the ground. And may your children be as the stars of heaven and the children of your livestock as horses and donkeys and oxen and sheep and swine and doves and camels and asses, as many as you desire, for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of fathers upon their children, to bring in everlasting righteousness to those who fear me and keep my commandments. ""You shall not commit adultery. You shall have no other gods before me, nor shall you make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or on earth beneath or in between the waters. Nor shall ye bow down to them or serve them. Ye shall serve me only. For I have set my face against that which is evil and my wrath is kindled against them that do such things."" (Deuteronomy 6:4-6) The Lord is my shepherd; I shall never leave the sheep of his fold, neither shall I take any of them for my own, but he shall be for me a peculiarly holy thing, a thing holy for ever and ever. His name shall forever be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God and The everlasting Father, Who brought down from the heavens the mighty ones of old, And redeemed us from our sins by his blood, That we should be holy and blameless before him, To do his pleasure and to love him; To walk humbly with him in holiness and in justice; And to keep his commandments and his statutes, As he commanded us, in all wisdom and understanding. To the end that we may serve him with fear and trembling, In singleness of heart, with wholeheartedness, without guile, Unto the glory of God the Father and of Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen.) (The Lord's Prayer is a prayer of thanksgiving to God for all that He has done for us in this life. In it we thank Him for the good things that have been given to us and ask Him to continue to bless us with the blessings that are to come. We also ask for His help and guidance in our daily lives, especially in those areas of our lives where we are most vulnerable, such as our relationships with our family and friends, our work and our personal relationships. Our prayers are also directed to our Heavenly Father who is the source of all our blessings and who has promised to help us through our trials and tribulations. As we pray, we ask that our Father in Heaven will give us wisdom, understanding, faith, hope, love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, self-control, magnanimity, humility, goodness, mercy and faithfulness. These are the qualities that will make us worthy of His love and will enable us to serve Him in His service and His kingdom. This is our prayer, O Lord our God: We ask Thee, by the power of Thy Holy Spirit, through Jesus Christ, Thy Son, who liveth and reigneth with Thy Saints on the right hand of Thine only-begotten Son. Through Him, now and forever and unto ages of ages, amen.)",0

(Reuters)Huma Abedin, a longtime aide to Hillary Rodham Clinton, is the subject of an FBI investigation into whether she sent or received classified information on her personal email account while working for the former secretary of state, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter.
.@HillaryClinton says she is ""confident"" she never sent classified info via email. pic.twitter.com/8zgXfzs9xM — ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) July 2, 2016
 the FBI is looking into the possible mishandling of classified material, including emails sent and received by Abedin while she was employed by Clinton at the State Department, the officials said. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly. FBI Director James B. Comey is expected to make a statement to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Thursday about the status of the probe, which was first reported by the New York Times. Clinton has repeatedly said she did not send or receive any information that was marked classified when she used her private server to send and receive work-related emails during her four years as the nation's top diplomat from 2009 to 2013. ""I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false,"" Clinton said in an interview with ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Wednesday, adding that she has ""no idea how this information got on there in the first place."" ""It was not in any way marked or designated as classified,"" she added. Abedin's lawyer, David Kendall, declined to comment, as did a Clinton campaign spokesman, Brian Fallon, who said the campaign was ""not aware"" of any investigation of Abedin. In a separate statement, Kendall said Abedin ""has been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with any and all inquiries from the appropriate authorities regarding her former employer, Secretary of State Clinton."" The FBI has been examining whether sensitive information was mishandled in connection with a computer server Clinton set up in her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., and used exclusively to conduct government business while serving as secretary. Investigators are looking at whether Clinton or her aides violated the Espionage Act by sending or receiving information through the server that could be seen or read by foreign intelligence services, officials have told The Washington Post. One official said investigators have found no evidence to support the theory that Clinton herself was the victim of a breach of security.",0

The children, ages 2 and 4, died from carbon monoxide poisoning, which can be caused by a variety of sources, including gasoline, diesel fuel, propane, and natural gas, the DSHS said. Both children were transported to the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, where they were pronounced dead. A third child, a 4-year-old girl, was treated at the hospital for minor injuries and released. All three children died within 24 hours of the incident. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of those who were affected by this tragic incident,"" said Dr. David Lakey, director of DSHS's Division of Environmental Health and Safety, in a news release. According to an investigation by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), the cause of death for the children is still under investigation. However, TCEQ officials said they believe the death was due to ""natural causes"" and that the investigation is ongoing. In a statement, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) said, ""I am deeply saddened to learn that two of my children have died as a result of exposure to gasoline fumes. This is a terrible tragedy for my family and for all Texans. I will do everything in my power to ensure that this tragedy does not happen to anyone else."" The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors.

6802,Five programming languages with hidden flaws vulnerable to hackers,"In the past few years, there has been a lot of talk about the security of the Internet of Things (IoT) and how to protect it from hackers. In this article, we'll take a look at some of these vulnerabilities and what you can do to mitigate them. We'll start with the most common ones, and then move on to the ones that are more difficult to exploit, but still have the potential to compromise your IoT devices.
1. Remote code execution vulnerability in the WebSocket protocol (CVE-2016-5195)
, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via a crafted web site, aka the ""WebSocket Remote Code Execution Vulnerability."" This vulnerability was first reported in February 2016 and was patched in March 2016. The vulnerability affects all versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, Opera and Microsoft Edge, as well as Microsoft Lync, Skype for Business, Office 365, SharePoint Online and other Microsoft products.The vulnerability is caused by the way that WebSockets are handled when a client sends a request to a server. When the server receives a response from the client, it checks to see if the response contains a specially crafted payload. If it does, then it will execute the code in memory. This can be exploited by an attacker who has physical access to an affected system, such as a web server or a device that is connected to it. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.Users who have not updated their software are not at risk of being affected by this vulnerability. However, if you have updated your software, you should ensure that you are running the latest version. For more information about updating, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article referenced here: https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2718785 2. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability, also known as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) or XRF (X-Frame-Options) 3. SQL Injection (SQLi) 4. Buffer Overflow (BOOST_SQUAD_OVERFLOW) 5.

7792,Researchers say birth control pill for men may soon be a reality,".Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) say they have developed a pill that can prevent sperm from fertilizing an egg. The pill, which has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), could be available as soon as next year, according to a study published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The pill works by blocking the action of a protein called FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), which is responsible for the development of male reproductive organs, including the testes, ovaries, and penis. When the hormone is blocked, the sperm are unable to fertilize the egg, leading to infertility in men who are infertile. In the study, researchers found that the pill reduced the number of sperm in a test tube by about 50 percent, compared with a control group that did not take the drug. They also found a significant reduction in sperm motility, or the speed at which sperm move through the tube. [10 Surprising Facts About Men]
...
""This is the first time that we've shown that a drug can block the ability of the male sex hormone to stimulate sperm production,"" study co-author Dr. Daniela Rus, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at UCSF, told Live Science in an email. ""It's a very important step forward in our understanding of how to prevent male infertility.""
 androgenic alopecia (AGA), also known as male pattern baldness (MPB), is a condition in which the hair follicles on the head and neck of men lose their ability to produce new hair. It can be caused by a variety of factors, such as a genetic mutation or a chemical imbalance, but it is most common in older men. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), an estimated 1.5 million men are affected by AGA worldwide, with the majority of cases occurring in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. There is no cure for AGA, although treatment can help reduce the frequency of hair loss and improve the quality of life for affected men, as well as their wives and children. However, there are no FDA-approved treatments for AGA, making it difficult for many men to find a doctor who is willing to prescribe them a medication to treat the condition.

656,AAA: Millennials Are Worse Drivers Than Teens,"A new study from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety (AFTS) has found that young drivers are more likely to be involved in fatal crashes than their older counterparts. The study, titled ""Young Drivers Are More Likely to Be at Fault in Fatal Crashes,"" was conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) and the Center for Automotive Research (CAR) in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). The researchers analyzed data from more than 1.5 million U.S. drivers between the ages of 18 and 34. They also looked at data on fatal crash rates for the same age group in other countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Turkey and Ukraine.
According to the study's authors, ""The results of this study are consistent with those of other studies that have shown that drivers under the age of 25 are at greater risk of being killed or seriously injured in a crash than older drivers."" The authors also noted that ""younger drivers have been shown to have higher rates of alcohol and other drug use, as well as a greater propensity to drive while impaired by alcohol or other drugs."" In addition, younger drivers were found to make up a higher percentage of those who had been arrested for driving while intoxicated, which could be a contributing factor to their higher crash risk. ""This study provides further evidence that the young driver is at increased risk for serious injury and death in crashes,"" the authors wrote in their conclusion.
...
The study also showed that, compared to drivers of all ages, drivers aged 18 to 24 were more often involved with fatal accidents. In fact, they were nearly twice as likely as those aged 25 to 34 to die in such crashes. Among the drivers who died in these crashes, nearly one-third (31 percent) were younger than 25 years of age, while the rest were aged 35 to 44, 45 to 54, 55 to 64, 65 to 74, 75 to 84, 85 to 94, 95 to 104, 105 to 109, 110 to 114, 115 to 119, 120 to 124, 125 to 129, 130 to 134, 135 to 139, 140 to 144, 145 to 149, 150 to 154, 155 to 159, 160 to 164, 165 to 169, 170 to 174, 175 to 179, 180 to 183, 184 to 186, 187 to 189, 190 to 192, 193 to 195, 196 to 198, 199 to 201, 202 to 204, 205 to 207, 208 to 211, 212 to 214, 215 to 218, 219 to 222, 223 to 226, 227 to 229, 230 to 232, 233 to 236, 237 to 240, 241 to 244, 245 to 247, 248 to 250, 251 to 253, 254 to 256, 257 to 258, 259 to 261, 262 to 264, 265 to 267, 268 to 271, 272 to 275, 276 to 278, 279 to 282, 283 to 284, 285 to 286, 287 to 288, 289 to 292, 293 to 294, 295 to 296, 297 to 298, 299 to 300, 301 to 302, 303 to 304, 305 to 306, 307 to 308, 309 to 310, 311 to 312, 313 to 314, 315 to 316, 317 to 318, 319 to 320, 321 to 322, 323 to 324, 325 to 326, 327 to 328, 329 to 330, 331 to 332, 333 to 334, 335 to 336, 337 to 338, 339 to 340, 341 to 342, 343 to 344, 345 to 346, 347 to 348, 349 to 350, 351 to 352, 353 to 354, 355 to 356, 357 to 358, 359 to 360, 361 to 362, 363 to 364, 365 to 366, 367 to 368, 369 to 370, 371 to 373, 374 to 375, 376 to 377, 378 to 379, 380 to 381, 382 to 383, 384 to 385, 386 to 387, 388 to 389, 390 to 392, 393 to 395, 396 to 397, 398 to 399, 400 to 401, 402 to 403, 404 to 405, 406 to 407, 408 to 409, 410 to 411, 412 to 413, 414 to 415, 416 to 417, 418 to 419, 420 to 421, 422 to 423, 424 to 425, 426 to 427, 428 to 429, 430 to 431, 432 to 433, 434 to 435, 436 to 537, 538 to 540.",0

 the Japan Times reported on Wednesday that Yoshihide Suga, chief executive officer of the Hyatt Regency Tokyo, made the comments in a conversation with the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, which is owned by the Nikkei business newspaper group.
Suga was quoted as saying: ""I don't think Jews should be allowed to live in Japan. I think they should go back to where they came from."" He also said that he would like to see Jews ""burn in hell"" and that the Holocaust was a ""fabricated story"". The comments were made in response to a question from the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Masahiro Yamada, who asked him whether he thought Jews were ""good people or bad people"". Sugaga said he did not know the answer to the question, but added that it was not his place to comment on other people's religious beliefs. He later apologised for the remarks, saying they had been taken out of context and he had not intended to offend anyone. The newspaper said it had received a complaint from a Jewish group and was investigating the matter. In a statement on its website, the company said: 'We are deeply sorry for any offence caused by our CEO's comments, and we will take the necessary steps to ensure that this does not happen again.' The company also apologised to Jewish people and the Jewish community in general, it said, adding that its CEO would be taking a leave of absence until the investigation into the incident is completed. It is not the first time that a high-profile figure in Japanese business has come under scrutiny for his views on Jews.

 the Seahawks are in the midst of a three-game winning streak, and they're on the verge of clinching a first-round bye with a win over the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday. The Seahawks have a chance to clinch the NFC West and a home playoff game against the Green Bay Packers, but they'll need to beat the Niners to do it. If they do, they will be the first team in NFL history to win three games in a row and clinch a playoff berth in back-to-back weeks.
The Seahawks' defense has been a big part of their success this season, as they've allowed the fewest points per game (17.5) and yards per play (4.6) in football. They've also allowed just one touchdown pass in their last three contests, which is the second-lowest number of passing touchdowns allowed by any team since the NFL began tracking the stat in 1970. Seattle's defense is also allowing the third-fewest passing plays of 20-plus yards, according to ESPN Stats & Information, behind only the New England Patriots and New Orleans Saints.",0

...
""I have decided to step down from my position as president effective immediately,"" said Dietz, who will remain on the board of trustees. ""I want to thank the Board of Trustees for their trust and confidence in me, and I look forward to continuing to serve as a member of their leadership team."" The university said in a news release that it will appoint a new president in the coming weeks. The board will hold a special meeting to elect a permanent president at its next regular meeting on Nov. 14. Dietzen's resignation will take effect at the end of that meeting, which will be held at 7 p.m. at UCSF's Mission Bay campus, according to the release. He will serve out the remainder of his term through the 2018-19 academic year. In his resignation letter, he said he was ""honored and humbled"" to have served as the president for the past four years and that he would continue to work to improve the quality of life for students, faculty, staff and the community. His resignation comes after a year in which the school has been rocked by a series of sexual assault allegations, including one involving a former student who said she was gang-raped by six men at a fraternity party in November 2012. At the time, university officials said they were taking the allegations seriously and had launched an investigation into the matter. But the investigation was later closed without any charges being filed. A year later, a second woman came forward with similar allegations against the same fraternity, alleging that she had been sexually assaulted by seven men during a party on campus in January 2013. That case is still under investigation by the district attorney's office, but no charges have been filed in connection with that case. Last month, another woman accused the fraternity of sexually assaulting her during an off-campus party last fall. She also filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, saying that her Title IX complaint was mishandled by UC San Diego and its president, Janet Napolitano, after she reported the alleged assault to campus police in October 2014. After the second case was closed in February, she filed another complaint against UCSD, this time alleging sexual harassment and retaliation against her for reporting the first incident. Both of those cases are still being investigated by university police and have not yet been resolved, said university spokesman Dan Mogulof in an e-mail to The Chronicle on Wednesday afternoon. UC Santa Cruz has also been embroiled in controversy in recent months, with allegations of a ""rape culture"" on its campus that has led to a number of high-profile cases of alleged sexual misconduct by students. Those cases have prompted the resignation of several university administrators and sparked a national debate about sexual violence on college campuses.",0

The funding request comes on the heels of the Trump administration's proposed budget, which would slash the agency's budget by more than a third and eliminate its Office of Legal Counsel. The proposed cuts would result in the loss of nearly 1,000 staff positions, as well as the elimination of a number of programs, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), and NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), the groups said in a letter to Congress.
""The Trump Administration is proposing to eliminate critical programs that protect the health and well-being of millions of Americans,"" said NRDC Senior Vice President Michael Brune. ""These cuts will have a devastating impact on our nation's fish and wildlife. We urge Congress to reject these cuts and instead provide the funding needed to ensure that our fish, wildlife and habitats are protected for future generations.""",0

The panel's ranking member, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., joins Rachel to discuss the letter and what it means for the 2018 midterms and 2020 presidential election.
.@RepCummings: ""This is not a partisan issue. This is a national security issue."" pic.twitter.com/x0zJX3QQqY — MSNBC (@MSNBC) June 27, 2017
 the number of people who will participate, and the amount of money that the government is going to spend to conduct it, will determine the makeup of the U.S. population in 2020. If the participation rate is lower than expected, it could lead to an under-representation of certain racial and ethnic groups, such as Latinos and African-Americans, who are more likely to be low-income and live in rural areas. On the other hand, if participation rates are higher than anticipated, the population could be more diverse and include more middle-class and upper-middle class people, as well as more people of color and people living in urban areas, according to a report from the Pew Research Center.

Georgia's special election to fill the seat vacated by Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price is shaping up to be one of the most expensive House races in recent memory, with more than $10 million in outside spending on both sides, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks money in politics. The race, which pits Democrat Jon Ossoff against Republican Karen Handel, is expected to draw as much as $20 million, the group said.
 the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that the race will be the second-most expensive congressional race in U.S. history, behind only the 2010 midterms, when President Barack Obama's re-election campaign spent $12.5 million to defeat Republican Sen. Thad Cochran in Mississippi's Republican Senate primary. That race was also seen as a bellwether for the 2018 midterm elections, as it was the first time a Democrat had won a Senate seat in a Republican-leaning state since 1964.",0

46,"From stone axes to cellphones, new project examines Amsterdam's history through 'junk'","The city of Amsterdam has a rich history, but it's not always easy to find out what it was like before the industrial revolution. That's why a team of researchers from the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) has been working on a project that aims to shed some light on the city's past. The project, called ""Junk"", is a collaboration between the Wits Institute for Archaeology and Ethnography (IoE) and the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York. It is the first project of its kind in the world, and is being funded by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013). The aim of Junk is to explore the history of a city through the ""unused"" objects that have been left behind by its inhabitants. ""We want to understand how people lived, what they ate, how they worked, where they lived and what happened to them after they died,"" says Joost de Vries, the project's lead researcher and a professor of archaeology at the IOE. He adds that the aim is not only to learn about the past but also to create a ""living archive"" that can be used by future generations to better understand what was going on in Amsterdam at that time. In order to do this, he says, ""we need to know what people were doing and why they did it."" The team has already found some interesting items, such as a stone axe that was used to chop down a tree. But the most interesting find so far was a cell phone, which was found in an abandoned building in a residential area. This phone was made from a piece of wood that had been cut from an oak tree and was covered with a layer of dirt and mud. According to the researchers, it is one of only a few examples of this type of mobile phone in existence today. They are currently working with the MoMA to see if they can get the phone back to its original owner, who is believed to be in his 60s or 70s.",0

1994,"Urusan jual, pindah milik kenderaan akan dilaksana secara 'online'","'Online' is a term used to refer to the internet. It is not the same as 'the internet' in the sense that it does not have a physical location, but rather a network of computers that are connected to each other through the Internet Protocol (IP) address. The IP address can be found on a computer's hard drive or in a web browser's address bar. A computer can have multiple IP addresses, each of which is assigned to a different computer on the network. For example, if you have two computers on your home network, one of them has an address of 192.168.0.1, and the other of the two has a new address that is 172.16.10.2. When you visit a website, the browser sends a request to one or both of these computers. If the request is successful, a response is sent back to your computer, which in turn sends the response to another computer. This process continues until all the requests have been processed, or until the computer is rebooted. In the case of an internet connection, this process can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes, depending on how fast the connection is and how many requests are being processed at any given time.
The term ""online"" is often used as a synonym for ""the Internet"", but it is actually a misnomer. ""The Internet"" refers to an interconnected set of computer networks, not to any single computer or computer network itself. There is no such thing as the ""Internet"" as we know it today. Instead, there are a number of interconnected networks that make up the global Internet.

CADAGAN CREEK CERTIFICATE OF ESTABLISHMENT (CCEE) FOR A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT (NPP) IN PEMBROKE TERRITORY (Pembrokeshire, Wales)
... The Cadagan CCEe for a Nuclear Power Plant is granted by the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change (SECC) in accordance with the provisions of the Nuclear Decommissioning and Safety Act 2006 (the ""Nuclear Act""). The Nuclear Act provides for the grant of a Cadagaan Certificate of Establishment (CCEE) to a person who proposes to construct, operate, maintain or decommission an NPP in Wales. A Cadagon CEE is a document issued by SECC in which the applicant certifies that: (a) he or she is in possession of all the necessary documents and information necessary to enable him or her to carry out the proposed activities; and (b) the activities proposed to be carried out comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those relating to nuclear safety and radiation protection. The applicant must also submit a detailed plan of work, which must include the following: a) a description of how the planned activities will take place; b) an estimate of cost of construction and operation; c) details of any environmental impact assessments; d) any other relevant information; e) if applicable, a statement that the application is being made on behalf of an organisation or person other than an individual; f) evidence of financial support from the Welsh Government; g) information on the person's qualifications and experience; h) such other information as may be required. In addition to the requirements set out in section 2(1)(a)(i), section 3(2) and section 4(3), the Cadagans are also required to submit an application form. This form must be completed and signed by an authorised person, and must state the name, address, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address of each person to whom it is addressed, as well as the names and addresses of those persons who are authorised to act on their behalf. If an applicant does not have the required documents or information, or if they are unable to complete the form, the secretary of state for energy and climate change may refuse to grant the certificate of establishment and may refer the matter to an independent body, such as a Welsh Nuclear Safety Authority (WNSA) or the Office of Nuclear Regulation (ONR). The application must then be referred to ONR, who will make a decision on whether or not the project should be approved. On the basis of this decision, an approval may or may not be granted, depending on a number of factors. These factors include: the level of risk to public health and safety; the extent to which a project is likely to contribute to Wales' long-term energy security and security of supply; whether there are alternative sources of energy that can be used to meet the energy needs of Wales and whether these alternatives are economically viable; if there is an alternative source of electricity, how much it will cost and how long will it take to generate and supply the electricity; how many people will need to live within a radius of one kilometre around the nuclear plant to ensure the safety of people living near the plant and to minimise the risk of radiation exposure to them and their families; what the economic benefits and risks are of building and operating the facility and what will happen if the site is not built and operated successfully. An application may also be refused if it has not been submitted in a timely manner, is incomplete, contains false or misleading information or is otherwise not in compliance with any provision of these regulations. For more information about the process for applying for and obtaining a Ccee, please see the section entitled ""How to Apply for an Approval"" in this guidance note.

He was taken to MedStar Washington Hospital Center, where he was listed in ""serious but stable condition,"" the hospital said in a statement. The shooter, identified as James T. Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Ill., died of his injuries, the police said. ""We are deeply saddened by this tragedy, and our thoughts and prayers are with the members of Congress and their families,"" House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who were briefed on the shooting by the House sergeant at arms, said at a news conference. They said they were ""deeply concerned"" about the shooter's mental health and that he had a history of mental illness and had been involuntarily committed several times in recent years, including to a psychiatric hospital in Illinois. Rep. Mo Brooks, a Republican from Alabama and a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, was among the first lawmakers to arrive at the scene. Brooks said he saw a man who appeared to be in his late 20s or early 30s, wearing a baseball cap with a ""Make America Great Again"" sticker on it, running toward the baseball field with an AR-15 assault-style rifle and ""a baseball bat in one hand."" ""He was yelling, 'Allahu Akbar,' "" Brooks told reporters, using the Arabic phrase for ""God is great."" Brooks described the man as a white male, about 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighing about 180 pounds, with blond hair and blue eyes. It was not immediately clear if the gunman was a local resident or a visitor from out of town. A woman who identified herself as the suspect's mother told The Washington Post that her son was ""mentally ill."" The woman, who did not want to give her name, told the newspaper that she and her husband had recently moved to Alexandria from the Chicago area. She said she had no idea why the family had moved from Illinois to Virginia, but she did say that their son had ""mental health issues"" and was being treated by a mental-health facility. Police said that the incident began when a gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers practicing for a charity baseball game, injuring several of them. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File) The shooting occurred at about 10:30 a.m. local time, just before the annual charity game between the Washington Nationals and the New York Mets at Nationals Park in Washington. President Trump and first lady Melania Trump were in town for the game. Trump was briefed by his national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, as well as White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, both of whom are close to Trump, The Post's Philip Rucker and Karen DeYoung report. In a tweet, Trump said, ""Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't know if you were aware of this but it is only getting worse.

6460,Jonesborough to keep adding flouride to town water supply,"The council has been accused of trying to cover up the contamination of the town's drinking water after it was revealed that the council had been using the same water source for more than a decade.
A report by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has found that a number of residents have been exposed to high levels of boron, a chemical used in the manufacture of fertilisers and pesticides, in their water supplies since the early 1990s. The EIA said it had found evidence of contamination at three water treatment plants, two of which were used to treat the water supplied to homes and businesses. It said that at the time of its investigation, there was no way of knowing how many people were affected, or how long it would take for them to be diagnosed with cancer or other diseases linked to the chemical.
...
""We have no idea what the long-term effects of this contamination will be on people's health, but we do know that there is a very real risk of cancer and other health problems for people who drink the contaminated water,"" said the report's co-author, Dr David Parnell, from the University of East Anglia's School of Environmental Science and Health. ""We need to do everything we can to protect the health of those who live and work in this area, and to ensure that this problem does not happen again."" The report, which was published on Monday, said: ""There is no doubt that people living and working in these areas should be concerned about the potential health risks associated with the use of these water sources."" It added that ""there is an urgent need for a full and independent investigation into the extent and nature of any contamination and the possible health effects that may be caused by exposure to this water"". The investigation was prompted by a series of complaints from residents who said they had experienced symptoms such as skin rashes, headaches, nausea and dizziness after drinking tap water that had not been treated properly. One resident told the BBC that she had developed a tummy ache and had to go to hospital. Another said she was suffering from headaches and nausea, while a third said her hair had fallen out and her skin had turned blue. In a statement, the local council said its water was safe to drink and that it did not use any chemicals that could be harmful to human health. However, it admitted that its treatment process was not up to scratch and it needed to make changes to improve the quality and quantity of water it supplied. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which is responsible for Defra's water and waste management, told BBC News Online that he could not comment on individual cases. But he said he was ""concerned"" about reports of ""potentially harmful chemicals"" being used by local authorities.",0

The most notable of these was the assassination attempt on North Korea's leader in 1994, which was carried out by a group of defectors from the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and the Korean People's Army (KPA). The plot was foiled, but the plotters were sentenced to death by firing squad and executed in a public square in Pyongyang. In 1998, the WPK was blamed for the murder of a South Korean businessman in Seoul, who was shot and killed in front of his wife and children. A year later, in 1999, a Korean-American businessman was assassinated in Washington, D.C., while he was on a business trip to the U.S., and in 2000, two North Koreans were arrested in connection with the killing of an American tourist in South Korea.

""She's got the experience, she has the judgment, and she's the right person for the job,"" he said of Clinton, who is expected to formally announce her candidacy for president on Monday. Clinton has said she will make a decision on whether or not to run by the end of this year. The former first lady, U.S. senator and first woman to win the presidential nomination of a major political party will be the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee if she decides to seek the White House in 2016.

To be reunited with them, after all the pain and suffering that you've caused them? Would that make you feel any better, knowing that there's someone out there who cares about you and wants to help you in any way they can? If so, please, do me a favor and kill yourself.

The DSB report said the missile was launched from territory controlled by pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country. The report did not say who fired it, but said it was likely a Russian-made SA-11 missile, which has a range of up to 3,000km (1,200 miles). the report also said there was no evidence that the plane was hit by an air defence system, such as the US-led anti-missile system known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD), which is being deployed in South Korea to protect against the threat of North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. Russia has repeatedly denied that its forces were responsible for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine in July 2014, and has accused the West of trying to cover up the incident in order to deflect attention from its own military involvement in Ukraine. ""There is no doubt that this was a deliberate act of war by Russia,"" said Dutch Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans in a statement. He added: ""This report confirms what we have been saying all along: that Russia was behind the shooting down of MH-17 and that it is now time for Russia to face the consequences of its actions."" The Russian defence ministry dismissed the findings, saying they were ""politically motivated"" and ""not based on the facts"". The US and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in March 2014 and its support for rebels fighting government forces in east Ukraine, where more than 6,500 people have died since April 2014.",0

The students say that the development, which is located on the campus of UC Berkeley's Graduate School of Architecture and Planning, is a blight on campus and that it is unsafe for students to live in the building. ""We are calling on Governor Cuomo to take immediate action to address the safety and security of our students, faculty, and staff,"" the students wrote in a letter to the governor. They also said that they are ""deeply concerned about the impact of this development on our community."" The letter was signed by more than 100 students and faculty members, including the school's president, Robert Birgeneau, as well as a number of students who have been living in Brokenlyn for the past two years. In an interview with CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, Birgeneau said he was ""shocked"" by the letter, adding that he had ""no idea"" what was going on. He said the university was working with the developer to find a solution that would be ""good for everyone."" ""I don't know what's going to happen,"" he said, ""but I know that we are working very hard to make sure that this doesn't happen again."" In a statement to ""CBS This Morning,"" Cuomo spokesman Kevin Roberts said: ""Governor Cuomo is committed to ensuring that all New Yorkers have access to quality, affordable housing. As part of that commitment, he has directed the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to conduct a comprehensive review of all housing developments on state-owned property. This review will include an assessment of whether or not these developments are in compliance with state and federal laws and regulations. If the review determines that a development is in violation of state or federal law or regulations, it will be subject to immediate and appropriate corrective action."" Roberts added that ""the governor has also directed HUD to work closely with local officials to ensure that these communities are safe and secure for all of their residents."" He also noted that Cuomo's office has been in contact with ""a number"" of local and state officials ""who have expressed their concern about this issue and are actively working to resolve the situation."" But Roberts also acknowledged that there is no ""silver bullet"" that will solve the problem of brokenlyn, saying that more work needs to be done in order to get the issue ""under control.""",0

The iconic neon sign at the intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Main Street in downtown Albuquerque has been taken down and is being replaced with a new sign, according to the Albuquerque Downtown Development Authority (ADDA). The sign was originally installed in the 1970s and was the first of its kind in New Mexico. It was later replaced by a similar sign on the other side of the street. Now, the ADDA is looking to replace the sign with something a little more modern. ""It's going to be a much more contemporary sign,"" said Adrienne Pacheco, director of marketing and communications for the city of Albuquerque. She said it will be similar in design to other neon signs that have been installed around the country. Pacheros said they are still looking for a company to design and install the new neon signage. They hope to have it up and running by the end of this year.",0

2862,Millions of Christians worship wrong relics," of the past.It's not just the Catholic Church that has a problem with relics. It's also the Orthodox Church, the Protestant Churches, and the Jewish and Muslim faiths. All of these faiths believe that the body of Jesus Christ is the most important thing in the world and that it should be preserved and venerated as such. The problem is that these beliefs are not shared by the vast majority of people. In fact, according to the Pew Research Center, only about one-third of Americans believe in Jesus as the Son of God. That's a far cry from the 80 percent who believed in Christ as their personal savior when he died on the cross for our sins and was raised again to be our Lord and Savior. And it's even worse than that. According to a recent Gallup poll, just over half of all Americans (52 percent) think that Jesus was a real person, not a myth or a man-made figure. This is a huge problem for the Christian faith, because it means that only a small percentage of believers actually believe what the Bible says about Jesus and his crucifixion, resurrection and ascension to heaven. As a result, many Christians have a hard time reconciling their faith with what they see around them, which is why so many of them turn to religion as a way to cope with their feelings of alienation and alienation from their families and communities. But the problem isn't just that Christians don't believe the same things that everyone else does, but that they believe them in ways that are completely at odds with the way the rest of us do. For example, some Christians believe Jesus died for their sins, while others believe he was resurrected and ascended into heaven to live with God for all eternity. Some Christians say that if Jesus had not been crucified, he would still be alive today. Others say he didn't die at all, that he is still alive in heaven and will come back to earth at the end of time to judge the living and those who will be judged after he has left this world. These are just a few examples of how Christianity has become a religion of its own, one that doesn't share the values and beliefs of other religions. So what can be done about this problem? The first thing we need to do is recognize that there is no such thing as an ""authentic"" Christian. There are no ""true"" Christians. We are all Christians in our own unique ways and we all have different ways of relating to God and to each other. If we are going to have any kind of meaningful relationship with one another, we have to learn to recognize our differences and work together to find common ground. To do that, it is important that we recognize the difference between what we call ""Christian"" and ""Catholic"" or ""Protestant."" These terms are often used interchangeably by Christians and non-Christians alike. However, there are some important distinctions that must be made between the two terms. First, a Catholic is someone who believes that God is one in essence and in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. A Protestant, by contrast, believes in a plurality of persons in one Godhead. Second, Catholics and Protestants differ in how they view the relationship between God the Father and Jesus the Christ. Catholics tend to see the Trinity as one, whereas Protestants see it as three distinct persons, each of whom is God in his or her own right. Third, Catholic and Protestant beliefs about the nature of Christ's death and resurrection are very different. Catholic doctrine teaches that Christ died and rose again in order to save us from our sin and bring us to eternal life. Protestants, however, do not accept this doctrine. Instead, they teach that our salvation is by grace alone through faith alone, without any merit or works of any sort. Finally, as Catholics we should not be afraid to speak out against the teachings of some of our Protestant brothers and sisters. While we may not agree with them on every issue, when it comes to issues of faith and morals we can and should stand up for what is right and wrong.",0

2851,Six reasons why Putin's victory has frightened the West,":1. Putin is the first Russian leader to win a presidential election since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and he has done so in a way that is unprecedented in the post-Cold War era. He has been able to do so because of a combination of factors, including the fact that he is a charismatic leader who has managed to unite the Russian people around his vision of Russia's future. This has allowed him to appeal to a broad cross-section of Russian society, from the middle class to the working class, as well as to those who have traditionally voted for the ruling party, the United Russia party. The result is that Putin has won the support of more than two-thirds of Russians, a figure that has not been reached since at least the early 1990s, when Mikhail Gorbachev was in power. In fact, Putin may have won more votes than any other Russian president in modern times, with the exception of Boris Yeltsin, who won a landslide victory in 1996.2. As a result of his victory, Russia has become the world's largest exporter of oil and natural gas, making it a major player in global energy markets. It is also the largest producer of weapons of mass destruction.3. Russia is now a member of NATO and the European Union, which means that it has a strong military presence in Eastern Europe.4. Because of its position as a nuclear power and its ability to project military power far beyond its borders, Moscow has the potential to dominate the entire Eurasian landmass.5. With its economy growing at an average annual rate of 7.7 percent over the past five years, Russian gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to reach $1 trillion by the end of this year, up from $890 billion in 2008.6. Despite the economic downturn, Russians are optimistic about the future, believing that their country is on the right track and that they can achieve their goals through hard work and determination. They are also confident that the country's political system will continue to work in their favor, even if it takes a while for things to get back to normal.",0

The first was in 1948, when the state of Israel was established. At that time, the Jewish population of Judea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip was reduced to less than 200,000, while the Arab population increased to more than 1.5 million. This was the result of a policy of ""ethnic cleansing"" in which Jews were forced to leave their homes in order to make way for the creation of an ethnically pure Jewish state. Since then, there have been repeated accusations that the Israeli government has engaged in ethnic-cleansing policies, such as the confiscation of Palestinian property, forced evictions, demolitions of Arab homes, or the construction of Jewish settlements on Palestinian land. However, these accusations have never been substantiated. Instead, they have always been used as a pretext to justify Israel's continued occupation and colonization of Palestine, as well as its denial of basic human rights to the Palestinian people, including the right to self-determination and freedom of movement.",0

 the suspension of work is the latest in a string of setbacks for the 1,200-km (750-mile) line, which is being built by state-owned China Railway Corp (CRRC), the world's second-largest train maker after Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE), and is seen as a symbol of President Xi Jinping's ""Belt and Road"" initiative to promote trade and investment across Asia and beyond.

The statement did not give a reason for suspending the work. CRRC said it was not aware of any work stoppage. ""We are closely monitoring the situation,"" the company said in an emailed statement. It added that it would ""continue to work closely with the relevant authorities to resolve the issue as soon as possible.""

.
,
The New York Islanders have won their first game of the 2016-17 season, defeating the New Jersey Devils 4 to 1 in overtime at Barclays Center on Wednesday night. The win was the first for the Islanders since a 3-2 win over the Tampa Bay Lightning on Oct. 31.The Islanders were without captain John Tavares, who is out indefinitely with a lower-body injury, as well as defenseman Calvin de Haan (upper body) and goaltender Thomas Greiss (lower body). The team also lost forward Kyle Okposo to an upper body injury in the second period, and defenseman Travis Hamonic to a knee injury.Goalie Jaroslav Halak stopped 30 of 31 shots for his first career shutout. Islanders head coach Jack Capuano was pleased with his team's effort, saying, ""I thought we played a very good game. We had a lot of chances, but we didn't capitalize on them. It was a good win for us. I thought our guys played well. They played hard, they played smart and we had some good chances. But we just couldn't finish them off.""The Devils were coming off a 5-3 loss to the Montreal Canadiens on Tuesday night, which dropped them to 2-4-0 on the season. Goalie Martin Brodeur was pulled after allowing four goals on 17 shots in a loss at the Buffalo Sabres on Saturday. Devils coach Peter DeBoer was not happy with the performance of his netminder, calling him ""not good enough"" in his post-game press conference. ""We've got to find a way to get him out of there,"" he said.De Boer also said that he would not be making any changes to his lineup for Thursday's game against the Toronto Maple Leafs. He did, however, make a couple of minor roster moves, bringing in forward Travis Zajac from the Albany Devils and signing defenseman Adam Larsson from Albany to take his spot on Albany's top defensive pairing.In addition, the team announced that forward Matt Martin has been placed on injured reserve, retroactive to Nov. 28. Martin was injured on a hit from behind by the Boston Bruins' Zdeno Chara in Game 2 of their Eastern Conference Quarterfinal series.Martin has not played since suffering the injury and is expected to miss at least six to eight weeks",0

 the OCR's report, which is based on a range of economic models, is the latest in a series of warnings about the economic consequences of Britain's decision to leave the 28-nation bloc. Economists at the Bank of England, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and others have all warned of a ""hard Brexit"", in which Britain would lose access to the single market and customs union, as well as the ability to negotiate trade deals with other countries outside the bloc, including the United States and Canada. In a report published in March, economists at Oxford Economics warned the government that Brexit would lead to a fall in GDP of between 1% and 2% over the next five years, while the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said it could be as much as 5%. The IFS has also estimated that Britain could lose up to £50bn a year by 2030 as a result of its departure from the world's largest trading bloc – a figure that is expected to rise to between £100bn and £150bn by 2040, depending on how long it takes to secure a new trade deal with the remaining 27 member states.",0

6934,White Nationalist Rally At Texas A&M Has Been Canceled,"Enlarge this image toggle caption David J. Phillip/AP Dave Philipps/AFP/Getty Images Dave Phillphet/EPA David Phillip /AP David Phillips /EPA
 the rally had been scheduled to take place on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin on Saturday, but the event has been canceled, according to the Austin American-Statesman, which first reported the news. The rally was to have been attended by white nationalists, neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members and other far-right groups, including the Traditionalist Workers Party, a white nationalist group that has called for a ""white ethnostate"" in the U.S., and the National Socialist Movement, the Southern Poverty Law Center says. It's not clear whether the group was planning to hold a counter-rally, or if it was just a coincidence that the two events were being held at the same time, as NPR's David Folkenflik reports. ""It's a very, very small group of people, and I don't think it's going to be a big deal,"" said David Duke, who organized the original rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August. Duke told NPR that he was not involved in organizing Saturday's rally, though he did speak at it. He said he had no plans to attend the one in Austin, where he said about 1,000 people were expected to show up to protest the planned removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from Emancipation Park, near the university's campus in downtown Austin. In a statement, UT-Austin President Gregory Fenves said the school was ""deeply saddened"" by the cancellation, adding that ""the university will continue to work with law enforcement to ensure the safety of our students, faculty, staff and visitors."" ""The university is deeply saddened by today's events,"" he added.

3740,A unified Korea? Leaders bring contrasting visions to summit,"By Kim Eun-jungSEOUL, April 28 (Yonhap) -- North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, and his South Korean counterpart, Hwang Kyo-ahn, agreed Monday to hold a summit meeting in the near future to discuss the North's nuclear and missile programs, the South's Unification Ministry said in a statement.The two leaders also agreed on the need for the two Koreas to work together to resolve the issue of the Korean Peninsula's reunification, it said.Hwang, who is in charge of inter-Korean affairs, will hold talks with Kim at the border village of Panmunjom, near the demilitarized zone (DMZ), the ministry said, adding that the meeting will be held within the next few days.North Korea and South Korea are technically still at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. The two sides have been at odds since the early 1990s, when Pyongyang launched a long-range rocket in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions and Seoul and Washington began joint military drills.South Korean President Lee Myung-bak and North Korean leader Kim have held several rounds of high-level talks in recent months, but no summit has yet been scheduled.In the past, they have met only once, in 2010, during a visit by then-U.S. President Barack Obama to Seoul, where they agreed to restart the stalled Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC), a joint industrial zone that was shut down in 2009 after Pyongyang's third nuclear test.During the visit, Obama said he was ""deeply concerned"" about the situation in Northeast Asia and called on Pyongyang to stop its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile activities. He also called for a resumption of six-party talks aimed at denuclearizing the peninsula.Obama's visit came as the United States and its allies have stepped up their military exercises in response to a series of missile and nuclear tests by Pyongyang, which has vowed to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the mainland.Pyongyang has said it has the ability to hit the entire mainland with its missiles, though experts say it is unlikely to be able to do so given its limited range and lack of a reliable nuclear warhead.

263,"Members of Congress receive threats, consider security following shooting"," of Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., in Alexandria, Va., on June 14, 2017. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images)WASHINGTON — A gunman opened fire on a congressional baseball practice Wednesday, killing at least four people and wounding several others before he was shot and killed by Capitol Police, authorities said. The gunman, identified as James T. Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Ill., was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the parking lot of the baseball field where the shooting took place, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation. He was the only person killed in Wednesday's shooting, which occurred at a practice for the Congressional Baseball Game, a game between the House and Senate that is played at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., about an hour's drive from the White House. ""We are deeply saddened by this tragedy,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement, ""and our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, and all of those who were involved in today's tragic events."" The official said the shooter was armed with an AR-15-style assault rifle and a handgun, both of which were recovered at the scene. It was unclear whether the gunman had any accomplices. A congressional aide who was present during the incident told The Associated Press that the suspect was a ""lone wolf"" who had no apparent ties to any political party or organization. But the aide, who asked not to be identified, said he believed the man was motivated by his opposition to President Donald Trump and his support for Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who lost the Democratic presidential primary to Hillary Clinton last year. Sanders was one of several congressional Democrats who criticized Trump's response to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Aug. 12, in which a car plowed into a crowd of counterprotesters. Trump blamed ""many sides"" for Saturday's violence and said there were ""very fine people on both sides."" ""I think it's a horrible thing that's taking place in our country,"" Sanders said on CNN's ""New Day"" on Wednesday morning. Asked whether he thought the president should have condemned the white supremacists and neo-Nazis who attended the Charlottesville rally, Sanders replied: ""No. I think what we have to do is come together as a country and say, 'Enough is enough.' "" The aide also said that Sanders had been in touch with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, the No. 2 House Democrat, about his thoughts on the matter. Pelosi said she was ""shocked and saddened"" by the shootings and that she had spoken to Sanders about it. She did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a tweet Wednesday afternoon, Trump called the attack ""an act of terror and an assault on all that we hold dear as Americans."" He added that ""the victims of this heinous act were standing up to hate and bigotry. We must stand united and defeat them in every way we can."" Trump has been under intense pressure from Democrats and some Republicans to denounce white supremacist groups and their sympathizers after a series of racially charged incidents in recent weeks, including the killing of an African-American man, Alton Sterling, by a white police officer in Baton Rouge, La., last week and the death of three police officers in Dallas on July 7, when a sniper shot at them during a protest over the fatal police shootings of two black men in Minnesota and Louisiana. On Tuesday, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield, Calif., called on Trump to ""condemn white supremacy in all its forms"" and ""speak out forcefully against the hate groups that have been emboldened by President Trump."" In an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos on ""Good Morning America"" that aired Tuesday morning, Ryan declined to say whether Trump should speak out more forcefully, but he did say that Trump ""has a responsibility to make sure that his words and actions are consistent with what he believes is the best interest of his country."" Ryan, speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, was asked if Trump had the ""moral authority"" to condemn white nationalist groups. Ryan replied that he didn't think so, adding that it would be ""unfortunate"" if a president ""didn't have the moral authority to stand up for what's right and wrong."" On Wednesday evening, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, another Republican who has spoken out against white nationalists, told reporters that there is ""no doubt in my mind that this is a domestic terrorist attack."" But he said it was too early to draw conclusions about a possible connection to terrorism, saying that investigators were still trying to piece together the details of what happened and whether there was any link to international terrorism. Cornelius said ""there's no doubt""",0

Iranian and German officials said they had reached a deal on a long-term nuclear deal that would allow Iran to continue enriching uranium to 20 percent, the level needed to make a nuclear weapon, for at least 10 more years. A senior German official said the deal would also allow Germany to resume trade in Iranian oil and gas, which has been suspended for more than a year because of U.S. and European sanctions on Iran over its disputed nuclear programme.

It is believed to be the first time that a company has been raided in connection with the investigation, according to local media reports. The raid is said to have taken place at the headquarters of a subsidiary, Philips Consumer Electronics (PCE), which is based in Sao Paulo, Brazil's second-largest city and home to the country's biggest electronics retailer, Amazon.com Inc.

The artifacts were taken from a museum in Washington, D.C., by a group calling itself the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI), which has been accused by the Turkish government of being a front for the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The PKK is listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey and the U.S.",0

7907,SFSU study predicts rise in ticks this season,"The University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (IFAS) and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) have teamed up to study the impact of tick-borne diseases on the state's citrus industry. The study, funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is the first of its kind in the United States. It is expected to provide important information for growers and growers' organizations, as well as for public health officials.
""This is an important study because it will help us better understand the effects of ticks on Florida citrus growers,"" said IFAAS Associate Professor of Entomology and Nematology, Dr. Michael J. O'Hara. ""It will also provide valuable information to the public and policymakers about the potential impacts of diseases such as Lyme disease and West Nile virus on citrus production and tourism in Florida. We hope that this study will serve as a model for future research on this important topic."" The research is being conducted in collaboration with the FDACCS, the USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and Florida State University's College of Agricultural, Life, and Environmental Sciences. This study is part of the CDC's Tick-Borne Diseases Initiative (TBDI), which is a partnership between CDC and state and local health departments, universities, private industry and other partners to address the growing threat posed by ticks and ticks-transmitted diseases. TBI is caused by a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi, which can be transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected tick or by contact with infected ticks. In addition to being a serious health threat to people, ticks are also a major source of food for many wildlife species, including birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish and birds. A tick bite can cause fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, joint pain, swollen lymph nodes and swollen glands, among other symptoms. Tick bites can also lead to anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can result in a drop in blood pressure, heart rate and blood sugar levels. If left untreated, tick bites may cause permanent damage to a person's nervous system, resulting in paralysis, coma and death. According to CDC data, more than 1.5 million people are diagnosed with tickborne disease each year, with most of these cases occurring in children under the age of 5. More than half of all cases are in people who live in rural areas, where the risk of exposure to ticks is greatest. For more information, visit http://www.cdc.gov/tickbornediseases/index.html.",0

The S&P 500 index SPX, -1.07% ended at its highest level in nearly three years, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, down 0.2%, was the only major U.S. stock index to close above its 200-day moving average. Gold prices US:GCZ7 rose as much as 1.5% to a two-week high of $1,242.50 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil prices LCOc1 settled at $48.90 a barrel, up $2.30, or 2%, from the previous session's close. ""There's a lot of optimism in the market right now,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities Inc. in Stamford, Conn. He added that he expects the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates later this year, which would be good news for equities and the broader market. But he cautioned that the Fed is likely to be cautious about raising rates too soon, given that inflation is still below the central bank's 2% target, and that it could be a while before the economy starts to show signs of life again. Stocks have been on a tear since the election of Donald Trump, who has promised to cut taxes, boost infrastructure spending and cut regulations. Trump has also said he wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico and has threatened to impose tariffs on companies that move jobs to Mexico or other low-wage countries. In addition, he has called for a ""border tax"" on imports from Mexico to pay for his proposed border wall with Mexico. On Wednesday, the Dow closed above the 20,000 mark for only the second time since Nov. 8, 2016, according to FactSet data. That's the longest streak of record-breaking gains in a single day since Oct. 31, 2000, when the index hit a new record of 21,099.
""I think the markets are going to continue to move higher, but I don't think it will be as strong as it has been in recent weeks and months. I think we'll see a little bit of a pullback in some of these sectors, especially the energy sector, as we get closer to the end of this month,"" he said. Investors are also looking for signs that Trump's economic policies will have an impact on consumer spending, a key driver of economic growth. Consumer spending accounts for about 70% of gross domestic product (GDP) and is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 2.4% through the fourth quarter of 2017. Economists polled by MarketWatch expect the consumer price index (CPI) to rise to 3.1% in 2017, from 3% last month, with the unemployment rate falling to 4.9% from 5.3%. The Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to meet on Dec. 15-16 to discuss the outlook for economic activity and inflation. Read more: What to watch for in Trump-era Fed meeting The Dow is up nearly 1,200 points since Election Day, making it the best-performing major index since Trump took office on Jan. 20. It's also the biggest gain since March 2009, during the financial crisis. Shares of Amazon.com Inc., the world's largest e-commerce company, are up about 20% since election day. Amazon's stock has gained about 30% over the past 12 months, outperforming the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.SPSY by about 10%.

1350,Explosive detonates below NYC transit hub in 'attempted terrorist attack'," https://t.co/jX5q6Q0ZvB pic.twitter.com/XVJ0Kl0XlJ — New York Daily News (@NYDailyNews) November 1, 2017The suspect, identified as 29-year-old Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, was shot and killed by police after he allegedly drove a rented truck into a crowd of people on a bike path near the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, authorities said. He then got out of the vehicle and began stabbing people with a butcher knife before being shot in the abdomen by a police officer, according to the NYPD. The suspect was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, the department said in a statement. Police did not immediately release the suspect's name, but said he is a legal permanent U.S. resident who was born in Uzbekistan and was living in New Jersey at the time of his arrest. Authorities said they were investigating whether the attack was an act of terrorism or a hate crime. ""This is an attack on all of us,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference, adding that it was a ""cowardly act"" and that the city would not be cowed by it. De Blasio, who had been briefed on the investigation, said the attacker was not on any terrorist watch list and had no known ties to any terror group. A federal law enforcement official told NBC News that investigators were looking into whether he may have been inspired by the Islamic State group, which has claimed responsibility for a string of attacks in Europe and the United States in recent months, including a truck attack in Nice, France, in July that killed 84 people and a shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., in December in which 14 people were killed and 22 others were injured. Investigators were also trying to determine if he acted alone or was part of a larger network, and whether there was any link to terrorism in any other countries, a federal official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation. In addition to being an Uzbek national, he also had a green card and lived in Elizabeth, N.J., the official added. It was unclear if the man had any prior criminal history, or if there were any ties between him and any foreign terrorist organizations.

Supervisor David Campos is sponsoring the measure, which he says will protect the public's right to purchase fur. He says the fur trade is a major source of income for many San Franciscans and that it's time to take a stand against the practice.
.@sfgov will vote on @sffurban on Tuesday. pic.twitter.com/qjzJf8x8Zv — David Ramos (@DavidRamosKCBS) February 24, 2017
 the proposal would also prohibit the use of the word ""fur"" or ""furry"" in connection with any product, service, or activity, including advertising or promotion, unless the product or service has been approved by the board of supervisors. The measure also would prohibit any person from selling or offering for sale any fur product that does not meet the requirements of this measure. It would not apply to products or services that are not fur-related, such as clothing or accessories.The proposal comes after a series of high-profile incidents in which people have been charged with animal cruelty for killing animals for their fur or fur products. In January, a man was sentenced to six months in jail after he was found guilty of killing a dog for his fur coat. And in February, an 18-year-old woman was arrested after she was accused of stabbing a cat to death with a knife and then selling the cat's fur for $1,000.Campos says he wants to make it clear that this is not a ban on fur, but rather an effort to protect people's rights to buy and sell fur without fear of prosecution.",0

The mayor made the comments in an interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep, who asked him about his administration's efforts to address the problem. ""I think we've made a lot of progress,"" he said, ""but we still have a long way to go."" De Blasio's administration has been criticized for its slow response to the issue, which has become a major issue in the mayoral race. In the NPR interview, the mayor said he's ""very proud"" of the work he and his team have been doing. He also said that he has ""no doubt that we're going to be able to solve this problem."" ""We've been working on it for a very long time, and I'm very proud of what the people of this city have done to get us to where we are today,"" DeBlasio said. But he also acknowledged that ""there's still more work to do."" The city has spent more than $1 billion on street repairs over the past five years, according to city data. That's about half the amount spent by the previous mayor, Michael Bloomberg, when he was in office from 2001 to 2013. Deblasio's office has said it's working to reduce the backlog of repair requests, but it hasn't said how it plans to achieve that goal. A spokesman for the department said in a statement: ""The department is committed to working with the City Council and other stakeholders to find solutions to this backlog. We will continue to work collaboratively with our partners to ensure that all New Yorkers have access to safe, affordable and accessible streets and sidewalks."" On the campaign trail last year, de Blasio pledged to spend $100 million a year to fix the streets in his first term, a pledge that was met with skepticism from some of his Democratic rivals. On Tuesday, he told NPR that the money would be spent on a variety of projects, including street resurfacing, sidewalk repairs and bike lanes.",0

The Pakistani military said the militants were killed in an air strike in North Waziristan, a tribal region bordering Afghanistan. It was not immediately clear whether the strike was carried out by a drone or a missile fired from a fighter jet. The military did not say how many militants had been killed, but said they were believed to be members of the Haqqani network, an insurgent group that has links to al-Qaida and has been blamed for a string of high-profile attacks on US and Afghan forces in recent years. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Associated Press news agency that the drone strike had killed three ""high-value"" militants. He said it was too early to say who was responsible for the attack, which came a day after US President Barack Obama vowed to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" the militant group. ""We will continue to take action against those who threaten our country and our people,"" Obama said at a joint news conference with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in Washington on Monday. Pakistan has long complained about the use of its airspace by US drones, saying they violate the country's sovereignty and are a threat to its national security. US officials have repeatedly said that they do not target civilians, and that their strikes are aimed at militants who pose a ""continuing and imminent threat"" to the United States and its allies. But Pakistan's military and intelligence agencies have long accused the Americans of carrying out covert operations in their country, including the killing of dozens of Pakistani soldiers and civilians in cross-border raids in 2009 and 2010.",0

766,"Commuters Growing Frustrated With Renovations At Wantagh LIRR Station "" CBS New York"," ""New York City's subway system is in the midst of a major overhaul, and it's not going to get any easier any time soon. A new report from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) shows that the number of people using the subway has been declining for the past several years. The report, which is based on a survey of more than 2,000 subway riders, found that ridership on the system has declined by about 1.5 percent per year since 2008. That's a big drop, but not as big as it might have been if the MTA hadn't been spending so much money on new trains and stations. ""The MTA is spending a lot of money to build new subway stations and to upgrade existing stations,"" MTA Chairman Thomas Prendergast said in a statement, ""but we have not been able to keep up with the demand for service."" The MTA has spent $3.4 billion on station upgrades since 2009, according to the report.
The report also found a significant drop in riders who use the subways to commute to work. In 2008, 42 percent of the people who commuted by subway to their jobs used it to do so. By 2012, that number had dropped to 29 percent. It's unclear why this is the case. One possibility is that people are choosing to use other modes of transportation, such as walking or biking, instead of taking the train. Another possibility, however, could be that more people aren't taking public transit at all.

7937,Parkland shooting suspect's brother arrested for alleged trespassing at school," Copyright by WFLA - All rights reserved VideoLAS VEGAS (AP) - The brother of a man accused of fatally shooting a student at a Florida high school has been arrested in connection with the incident, police said Friday.
The suspect, who was not identified by police, was taken into custody at his home in Las Vegas, where he is being held on a $1 million bond, according to the Clark County Sheriff's Office. He is expected to be extradited to Florida to face charges in the shooting death of 17-year-old Jordan Davis, a freshman at Parkland High School in Orlando, the sheriff's office said in a news release. The shooting happened Friday morning at the school, which is located about 30 miles south of Orlando. Davis was shot multiple times and later died at Orlando Regional Medical Center. His death was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner. Police said the suspect is the son of the victim's mother, and that he had been in contact with his mother on Friday, but they did not provide further details about the relationship between the father and son. ""This is a very sad day for our community,"" Sheriff Jerry Demings said during a Friday afternoon news conference, adding that the investigation is still ongoing. No charges have been filed against the man, he said, because there is no evidence to support a charge of first-degree murder. A spokesman for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said he could not comment on the case because it is an active investigation. Deming said investigators are still trying to determine whether there was any connection between Davis' death and the gunman's father, whom he described as a ""person of interest."" ""We have no reason to believe that this is anything other than a tragic accident,"" he told reporters. In a statement released by his attorney, Davis said his family is ""devastated"" by what happened to him and his friends and is asking for privacy as they grieve the loss of their ""beautiful son, brother, nephew, cousin, friend and classmate."" He also thanked the first responders who rushed to his aid, saying they ""did the best they could to save my life."" The statement also said that his father was ""a good man who loved his son very much"" and ""would do anything to help anyone in need."" His mother was also a good woman who ""loved her family and her son dearly,"" the statement said. She ""was a loving and caring mother to Jordan and to all of her children,"" it added. It was unclear whether the shooter's parents were at home when he was arrested, or if they had any knowledge of his actions. They were not immediately available for comment Friday night. On Friday evening, school officials said they were ""shocked and saddened"" to learn of Davis's death. Superintendent John Deasy released the following statement: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with Jordan's family during this very difficult time. We will do everything in our power to assist them in any way we can. Our school is safe and secure and we will continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners to ensure the safety and security of our students and staff."" Davis is one of three students who were shot and killed by a gunman who opened fire on students at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, on Dec. 14, 2012, leaving 20 children and six adults dead.",0

He added that if the Brotherhood did not agree to his terms, ""we will have no other choice but to resort to force"". the president said that Egypt's armed forces were ready to intervene in the event of a coup d'état.

Morsi was elected president in July 2012, but was forced to step down after mass protests against his rule in which hundreds of people were killed and hundreds more were injured.

[Javascript required to view Flash movie, please turn it on and refresh this page] A federal judge has approved the sale of 26 grocery stores to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management in a deal valued at more than $1 billion. The deal, which was approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014. ""We are very pleased with the court's approval of this transaction and look forward to working with our customers and partners to serve them well for many years to come,"" Cerberus CEO Stephen Feinberg said in an e-mailed statement. In addition to the 26 stores, the deal will also include a number of other assets, including a grocery store chain, a pharmacy and a gas station, according to a press release from Cerberus. Cerberus is the parent company of the investment firm Blackstone Group and the private-equity firm Apollo Global Management. According to court documents, Cerberus has agreed to pay $2.5 billion in cash and $500 million in preferred stock over the next five years in exchange for a majority stake in Kroger Co., the nation's largest grocery chain. That stake will be worth about $3.2 billion after Cerberus receives a $400 million loan from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) to help finance the purchase. A spokesman for Cerberus declined to comment for this story. As part of its deal with Cerberus, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. will acquire the assets of two other grocery chains, Trader Joe's and Whole Foods Market, for $4.4 billion, in what is being described as a ""strategic transaction"" that will create a combined company with a market value of $13.7 billion and an annual sales of about 1.3 billion pounds of food and groceries. It's the second time in less than a year that a major supermarket chain has been bought by a private company. Last year, Target Corp.'s (TGT) purchase of Neiman Marcus was announced, and last month, CVS Caremark (CVS) announced that it was buying Rite Aid. Both of those deals have been criticized by consumer advocates, who say that they will lead to higher prices and fewer choices for consumers. But in this case, critics say, it's not just the price of groceries that's going up, but also the quality of what's on the shelves. Critics also point out that the stores that are being sold to Cerberus will not be able to compete on price with Walmart and other big-box retailers, such as Costco Wholesale Corp (COST) and Sam's Club Inc (SJR). ""This is not a good deal for taxpayers, consumers or the economy,"" Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), the top Democrat on Senate Finance Committee, told reporters at a news conference on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. Schumer said that he was concerned about the impact on small businesses that rely on grocery sales to make up the difference between what they can afford to buy and what their customers are willing to spend. He said he would work with his Republican colleagues on a bill that would prevent taxpayers from being forced to bail out the companies that were bought out by private investors.",0

1662,New storms bear down on California as crews rush to fix the spillways draining a swollen reservoir," in Oroville, Calif. (Reuters)California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) declared a state of emergency in the state's largest city, Los Angeles, and ordered the evacuation of more than 100,000 people from the area around the dam, which holds back the Feather River, a tributary of the San Joaquin River that flows into the Sacramento River. The water level at the reservoir, the tallest on the West Coast, rose to a record high of 9.1 feet on Sunday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
The dam's emergency spillway has been damaged by erosion and is no longer able to handle the weight of water that has built up in recent days, officials said. Officials said they are working to repair the damaged main structure, but it is not clear when that will be completed. A new emergency evacuation order has also been issued for the surrounding area.

The boy's mother, a nurse, said she was worried about her son's well-being and wanted to find a way to help him keep his diabetes under control. So, she decided to adopt a Labrador retriever, which is a type of dog that can be trained to monitor a person's blood sugar levels and alert the owner if they are in danger of hypoglycemia (low blood glucose). The dog, named ""Lucky,"" is named after a character in the movie ""The Little Rascals,"" which was based on the real-life story of a young boy who was adopted as a puppy by a woman who had diabetes. ""I thought it would be a good idea for my son to have a companion dog,"" the mother told ABC News. Lucky is now a part of the family, and the boy said he is ""very happy with him.""

The report, which is based on an analysis of the IOC's financial projections for the Rio Games, shows that the Games will be the most expensive in Olympic history, with an estimated $12.7 billion in costs. The IOC estimates the total cost to be $15.4 billion.

, the report says that Rio's infrastructure will cost an average of $2.5 billion per year. That's more than twice as much as the next-highest-cost city, Tokyo, where the average cost is $500 million. In addition to the infrastructure costs, Rio will also have to pay for a host of other expenses, such as security, transportation, and other costs associated with hosting a major international sporting event.The report also notes that there are a number of factors that could affect the cost. For example, if the Olympics were held in the United States, costs would be lower because the U.S. government would not be required to foot the bill. However, that's not necessarily the case. If the Olympic Games were to take place in another country, it would require the host country to cover the costs of infrastructure and security.In addition, there is also the question of whether or not the city of Rio would have the financial resources to host the games. Rio is a large city with a population of about 22 million people, making it the second-largest city in South America, after Buenos Aires. It's also home to many of Brazil's most popular tourist attractions, like Copacabana Beach and the Maracanã Stadium.",0

6137,Caught in a flap over posties’ refusal to deliver!,"The Post Office has been in the news a lot lately, and it's not for the reasons you might think. In fact, it seems to be getting more attention than ever before, thanks in large part to the fact that the Postal Service is facing a $4.5 billion budget shortfall, which is projected to grow to $5.6 billion by the end of the decade. The problem is that, according to a new report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the USPS is not doing enough to keep up with the ever-increasing volume of mail that it receives. According to GAO, the postal service has a backlog of more than 1.2 million pieces of correspondence that have not yet been delivered. That backlog is growing at a rate of about 1,000 pieces per day. And that's just the beginning of it. As you can imagine, this is a huge problem, especially for small businesses that rely on the post office for their business. So, what's the solution? Well, there are a number of things that can be done to address this problem. One of them is to make sure that all of our post offices are equipped to handle the volume that they're receiving. Another thing that we can do is improve the quality of service we provide to our customers. For example, if you're a small business, you may not be able to afford to hire a full-time postmaster, but you do have the option of hiring someone to do the job for you. If you don't have that option, then you need to find a way to get your mail to your customers as quickly and efficiently as possible. This is where the Postmaster General comes in. He is the person in charge of delivering the mail and is responsible for ensuring that every customer gets their mail as soon as it arrives at their door. Unfortunately, he's also the one who has to deal with all the problems that come along with dealing with so much mail. It's no wonder that he has such a hard time keeping up.",0

His office said in a statement that the congressman was in ""good spirits"" and that his family was ""devastated by the loss of their beloved son, husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle, nephew, friend, and patriot."" The statement did not say whether he had been shot by a police officer or by someone else. The gunman was identified as Gavin Long, a white man in his early 20s who had a history of mental health issues, the statement said. ""We are deeply saddened by this tragedy and our thoughts and prayers are with the family and loved ones of Rep. Ron DeSantis at this difficult time,"" said a spokeswoman for the Florida Republican.

Long was charged with two counts of attempted first-degree murder and one count of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence in connection with his alleged attack on the congressional baseball practice.

6761,"Suspect in Toronto van attack charged with murder, attempted murder after 10 die"," Copyright by WCMH - All rights reserved VideoTRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A suspect in the fatal stabbing of 10 people at a Toronto subway station has been charged in connection with the attack and is being held without bail in a New Jersey jail, authorities said Friday. The suspect, identified as 29-year-old Sayfullo Saipov, was taken into custody Thursday night after a shootout with police in New York City. He is expected to be extradited to the U.S. to face charges in that case, officials said. A federal law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the case publicly, said the suspect had been in contact with an FBI agent in recent days and was believed to have ties to a terrorist organization. ""We believe he was inspired by ISIS,"" the federal official said, using an alternative acronym for the Islamic State group. Saifullah Gülen, a Turkish-American imam who lives in Pennsylvania, is the spiritual leader of the Fethullahist Terrorist Organization, or FETÖ, which has claimed responsibility for a string of attacks in Turkey and Turkey's restive southeast, including a failed coup attempt in July 2016. In a statement Friday, the group said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the death of its leader, who it called a ""martyr"" and ""a true martyr."" The statement did not mention the Toronto attack, but it said that ""in the name of Allah, we offer our condolences to his family and loved ones, and to all those who lost their lives and were injured in this terrorist attack."" It also called on the Turkish government to ""take all necessary measures to ensure the safety and security of all its citizens."" A statement from the mayor of Toronto, John Tory, called the stabbing ""an act of terror and an attack on all of us."" ""Our thoughts and prayers are with all the victims and their families, as well as the police officers and emergency responders who are responding to this horrific incident,"" he said in an emailed statement. Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders said investigators believe the attacker acted alone and that there was no further threat to public safety. Authorities have not released any information about a possible motive, though they have said they are looking into the possibility that the incident was a hate crime. Police have also said there is no evidence to suggest terrorism was involved in Thursday's attack.",0

4227,Parents turn to crowdfunding to support maternity leave,"A new report from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) has found that more than one-third of Canadian women who have given birth in the last five years have not been able to take time off work to care for their newborns. In fact, the majority of these women have been forced to return to work after giving birth, leaving them with little or no time to spend with their new babies. The CCPA's report, ""Maternity Leave in Canada: What You Need to Know,"" is based on a survey of 1,000 Canadian mothers who gave birth between 2008 and 2012. It was conducted by Ipsos Reid, a Canadian public opinion research firm, and the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs, with the support of the National Women's Law Centre. ""It's important to note that this is the first time we've looked at this issue in such a comprehensive way,"" said Jennifer Keesmaat, senior policy analyst at the C.D. Howe Institute, who co-authored the report. She added that the study's findings are consistent with other research that has shown that women are more likely to leave the workforce when they have children. According to Statistics Canada, in 2011, women aged 25 to 34 were the only age group that had a lower rate of employment than women in their 20s and 30s, but the gap between the two groups has narrowed in recent years. Women aged 35 to 44 are the most likely of all age groups to be out of work, while those aged 45 to 54 and 55 to 64 have the highest rates of unemployment, according to the latest data from StatsCan. Keemasat said that while there are many factors that contribute to a woman's decision to stay at home with her newborn, one factor that is often overlooked is whether or not she has the financial means to do so. A woman who has a child and is working full-time can expect to earn about $1,500 a month, which is about the same as the average Canadian wage. However, if she is earning less than that, she may not have enough money to cover the cost of child care and other expenses, such as food and clothing, that come with being a stay-at-home parent. This is especially true if the woman is a single parent, as many single mothers are unable to find a job that pays enough to provide a decent standard of living for themselves and their children, said CPA executive director Janet Dench. As a result, many women may choose to give up their jobs and take a leave of absence from work in order to look after their babies, or they may decide that it's not worth the risk of losing their job if they can't afford to pay for childcare or other costs associated with caring for a new baby. While it may seem like a no-brainer that a mother should be paid for the time she takes off from her job, it can be difficult for employers to know what to expect from their employees when it comes to parental leave. Many employers don't have policies in place that allow them to calculate the amount of time that an employee can take off for maternity or paternity leave, making it difficult to determine how much time an employer will have to compensate its employees for taking leave for these reasons. For example, some employers may have a policy that allows employees to use up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in a 12-month period. If the employee takes a full 12 months of leave during that time, then the employer would be responsible for paying the difference in wages between what it would have paid if he or she had not taken the leave and what the company would pay if it had paid him or her the full amount. Some employers, however, may be more lenient with employees who take maternity and/or paternity leaves than they are with those who do not take any leave at all. One example of this could be the case of a company that offers a flexible work arrangement, where employees can work from home and still be compensated for all the hours they spend at work. Another example might be a family-owned business that does not offer any paid leave to its workers. These types of situations can create a situation in which employers are left with no choice but to either pay employees more or give them less leave than what they would otherwise be entitled to under their company's policy. When considering whether to offer a paid maternity/paternity leave policy to your employees, you should consider the following factors: How many employees will be affected by the policy? How much will it cost your company to implement it? What will the impact be on your business's bottom line? Will it affect your ability to attract and retain top talent? If you are unsure about whether your policy will affect the number of employees affected, contact your human resources department to discuss your options. What type of benefits will you offer to employees?",0

The report, released on Tuesday, found that ICE arrests of non-criminal immigrants have increased by nearly 50 percent since Trump took office in January, with the majority of those arrests occurring in California, Texas, New York, and Florida. In addition, the report notes that the increase in arrests has been driven largely by the arrest of undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes, such as driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or have been convicted of felonies. ""These arrests are a direct result of Trump's campaign promises to crack down on illegal immigration and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border,"" CIS Executive Director Mark Krikorian said in a statement.",0

According to the agency, the project will now be delayed until at least 2018, and will cost an additional $1.5 million to $2 million per month to complete. This means that the station will not be open by the end of the year, or even the beginning of 2018.
This is not the first time that construction has hit a snag for the transit agency. Earlier this month, it was reported that work on the Embarcadero BART station had been delayed for a second time, due to a lack of funding from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). The project was supposed to be completed in 2016, but has now been pushed back to 2017.",0

""I will do everything in my power to make sure that there is no war.""The Japanese leader also expressed concern over the possibility of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's regime launching a nuclear attack against the United States or its allies.""I am concerned about the threat of nuclear war,"" he said, adding that he will work with the international community to prevent such a situation from occurring.South Korea and Japan are technically still in a state of war because they fought a brief war in 1953 over a border dispute. The two sides have not had diplomatic relations since then, and Seoul and Tokyo have no diplomatic ties with each other.North Korea has threatened to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against Seoul if it goes ahead with plans to host the 2020 Summer Olympic Games. Seoul has said it is ready to defend itself and its citizens from any attack. (END) (By Park Si-soo and Lee Jin-man)",0

735,Ousted Hawaii State Worker Says He Thought Missile Threat Was Real,"Enlarge this image toggle caption David McNew/Getty Images/Ikon Images for The New York Times David MacNaughton/NPR David McGowan/AP David McDermott/Bloomberg via Getty Images 1 of 10 i View slideshow
, a former U.S. Air Force intelligence officer, told NPR's Scott Simon that he thought the missile threat was real. ""I thought it was a real threat,"" he said, ""but I didn't think it would be a nuclear warhead that was going to hit the United States."" He said he was in Hawaii at the time of the launch, and that it took him a while to figure out what was really going on, but he eventually figured it out: ""It was an intercontinental ballistic missile that had been launched from North Korea. And I thought, 'Oh, my gosh, that's a really big missile.' And then I realized it wasn't a missile at all. It was something that looked like an ICBM, which is a long-range missile. But it had a lot of fissile material in it, so it could have been a hydrogen bomb, or a thermonuclear weapon. So I was very, very surprised when I found out that this was not a conventional missile, because conventional missiles are not designed to carry nuclear weapons. They're designed for delivery of conventional weapons, like bombs and missiles and artillery and tanks and everything else that you need to fight a war. This was just a very large, heavy-duty missile with a bunch of highly enriched uranium and plutonium and other stuff that could be used to make an atomic bomb.... It's very hard for me to believe that the North Koreans were able to do this. I mean, it's not like they have a huge arsenal of missiles that they can launch from anywhere in the world. There's no reason why they would have had the capability to launch something like this from a launch site that is so far away from any of their nuclear facilities. That just doesn't make any sense to me."" In a statement to NPR, the State Department said it is ""aware of reports of a possible North Korean missile launch."" ""We are monitoring the situation closely and will continue to work closely with our international partners to ensure the safety and security of our citizens and our allies,"" the statement said. Kim Jong Un's regime has conducted a series of missile and nuclear tests in recent months, including a failed missile test in September. The United Nations Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on the country in response to the test.",0

This number is expected to rise to 2.5 billion by 2030. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) reports that the number of under-five children who die each year due to preventable causes has more than doubled since 1990, and is projected to double again by 2050. In the United States alone, one child dies every 30 seconds from hunger-related causes, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). In addition to hunger, malnutrition is a leading cause of death and disability among children in developing countries. It is estimated that one in three under five children suffers from stunting, a condition in which a child's height does not reach the average for his or her age. Stunting can lead to a host of health problems, including stunted growth, low birth weight (LBW), low weight for gestational age (WGA), and nutritional deficiencies, such as iron deficiency anemia and micronutrient deficiencies. Children who suffer from malnutrition are also more likely to die before reaching their fifth birthday than their peers who are not underweight.",0

Palestinian protesters throw stones at Israeli forces during a protest against the killing of a Palestinian teenager in Jerusalem's Old City on Friday. The teenager was shot dead by an Israeli border police officer after he allegedly tried to stab a soldier. Israeli police said the soldier shot and killed the Palestinian after the teenager allegedly stabbed him. AFP PHOTO / MOHAMMED ABED/AFP/Getty Images (MEMPHIS, TN - NOVEMBER 29: A Palestinian protester throws a stone towards Israeli security forces near the al-Aqsa mosque compound on November 29, 2015 in Memphis, Tennessee. Over the past few days, a series of stabbings, shootings and car-rammings have taken place across the United States, with the most recent incident taking place in a predominantly Muslim neighborhood in New York City's Upper East Side, where a Muslim man was stabbed to death by a man shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is great). The suspect, Sayfullo Saipov, was killed by police after ramming a truck into a crowd of pedestrians on a bike path in Lower Manhattan on Thursday night. Police have not identified a motive for the attack, but have said they are investigating whether it was an act of terrorism or a hate crime. In this photo released by the NYPD, the suspect is seen in this undated handout photo.

3398,Top Factors Driving the Global Potassium Sulfate Market,"The global potassium sulfate market is expected to grow at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 7.5% from 2015 to 2020, driven by a number of factors. These factors include the increasing demand for high-potassium foods and beverages, as well as the increased use of potassium-sulfur fertilizers in agriculture. In addition, the global market for potassium sulphate will continue to expand as a result of the growing demand in Asia and the Middle East for products that are low in sodium and high in potassium. The market will also grow in the United States, Europe, and Latin America due to the availability of low-cost sodium-free alternatives to sodium chloride and potassium bicarbonate, which are used in a wide range of products, such as baking, cooking, baking soda, laundry detergent, toothpaste, deodorant, soap, shampoo, body lotion, hair conditioner, shaving cream, soaps, shampoos, lotions, creams, lip balm, nail polish, cosmetics, toiletries, personal care products and other household products. Additionally, there will be an increase in demand from developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia Pacific, where there is a growing need to reduce the prevalence of chronic diseases and improve the health and nutrition of their populations. Finally, a significant portion of global demand will come from emerging markets, including China, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, Vietnam and Turkey.

2707,Dylan Nobel lecture used phrasing similar to SparkNotes,":""I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but there are a lot of people in the world who don't have access to the internet. They can't read the news or watch the TV or listen to music, and that's a big problem. And it's not just a problem for them. It's an issue for the entire world. So we're going to do something about it. We're gonna make it easier for people to access the information that they need to make informed decisions about how to live their lives and what kind of society they want to have. That's what I'm talking about. I've been thinking about this for a long time and I think I have a pretty good idea of what we should be doing. But I want you to be the judge of that. You're the one who's gonna decide whether or not this is the right direction for us to go in. If you agree with me, then you should vote for me. Otherwise, you shouldn't vote at all."" — Dylan Nobel, ""The Future of the Internet"" speech at the University of California, San Diego, September 27, 2011
.
The speech was delivered at a conference on the future of information and communication, hosted by the Center for Information Technology Policy (CITP), a non-partisan think tank in Washington, D.C. The conference was organized by a group called the Information Society Project (ISP). The ISP was founded in 2007 by two former members of President George W. Bush's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (CEAST), and its mission is to ""promote the use of technology to improve the quality of life for all Americans."" In the speech, Nobel said that ""the Internet has changed the way we live, work, learn and communicate."" He went on to say that the ""Internet is a force for good"" because ""it has given us the ability to communicate with each other in ways that we couldn't before."" But, he said, it has also created ""a new set of problems"" that are ""very difficult to solve."" The problem is that people ""don't know what they're missing out on"" by not being able to read, watch, listen, or play music online. ""We have to figure out a way to give people the tools to get the most out of their digital lives,"" he added. In other words, the problem isn't that there aren't enough people who can read and watch and listen online; rather, there's too much of a gap between what people can do online and how much they can actually do. Nobel's solution to this problem, as he sees it, would be to create a ""universal basic income"" (UBI) that would provide every American with a monthly stipend of at least $1,000. This would replace the current welfare system, which is designed to provide a safety net for those who need it most, such as the elderly and the disabled. As Nobel put it in his speech: ""I think we have an obligation to try to find a better way of doing things that will make people's lives better, not worse."" Nobel was not the first person to propose a UBI, of course. A number of economists, including Nobel himself, have advocated for such a system for some time. However, in recent years the idea has gained more and more traction, particularly among libertarians, who see it as a means of reducing the size and scope of government. According to a recent poll conducted by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic-leaning polling firm, more than half of Americans support a guaranteed annual income, while only about a third of Republicans and a quarter of Independents support such an idea. (The poll also found that a majority of Democrats and Republicans believe the government should do more to help the poor.) The idea is also gaining support among the general public, especially among young people. Last year, for example, President Barack Obama proposed a $10-an-hour minimum wage for federal contract workers, an increase from the $7.25 an hour currently paid to federal contractors.",0

Human rights commissioner Nihat Zeybekci has called on the Turkish government to ""change its course"" in the wake of the failed coup attempt on July 15, saying the country's democratic institutions are ""under attack."" ""The government has to change course,"" she said in an interview with private broadcaster CNN Türk. ""We are under attack from all sides, from the government, the judiciary and the armed forces. We are in a state of emergency, and there is no way out of it."" She added that Turkey's democracy is under threat, adding that it is ""very important"" for the state to protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their ethnicity, religion or political views. Ziya Meral, a member of parliament from President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), also called for a change of course. She said that ""the AKP is the only party in Turkey that defends the rule of law"" and that the ""government should not be allowed to use the coup as an excuse for its own power grab."" Murali Kartapolu, an MP with the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party of Turkey (HDP), said he was ""shocked"" by the attempted coup, which he described as a ""coup attempt against democracy."" He said the HDP ""will continue to fight for democracy and against coup plots."" The Turkish parliament is scheduled to hold a special session on Tuesday to discuss the events that led to the putsch. The government is expected to present a list of those it believes were behind the attempt to overthrow the democratically elected government. Erdo?an, who is also the prime minister, has accused the U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen of masterminding the plot and has vowed to hunt down the cleric and his followers. He has also ordered the arrest of more than 50,000 people, including soldiers, police officers, judges, teachers, civil servants, journalists and others suspected of having links to Gulen's movement.

The report did not give a reason for Hu's departure, but it was widely assumed to be related to his criticism of President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign, which has led to the arrests of several high-ranking party officials, including former Politburo Standing Committee member Bo Xilai and former Chongqing party chief Zhou Yongkang, as well as the detention of dozens of other officials and businessmen.
In an interview with the South China Morning Post, Hu said he had been forced to step down by the party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), which is in charge of investigating and punishing officials suspected of corruption. He said the CCDI had accused him of ""serious disciplinary violations"" and had asked him to leave his post. ""I have no choice but to resign,"" he said, adding that his resignation would not affect his ability to continue his work as a journalist. Hu also said that the decision to replace him with Wang was a ""political"" one and not based on his performance as an editor. Wang, however, told the Post he was not forced out of his job and was only asked to take a leave of absence to deal with ""personal matters."" He declined to comment further on the reasons for his departure.",0

2727,Ellis’ 3-pointers Help Michigan State Beat Ohio State 74-66," in the Big Ten/Big Ten Challenge.Michigan State (1-0) led by as many as 17 points in its first two games, but the Buckeyes (0-1) scored the first seven points of the second half to pull away. The Spartans had a chance to tie the game with less than a minute to play but missed a pair of free throws that would have given them a two-point lead with 1.9 seconds to go. But the Spartans missed another free throw, and they were forced to call a timeout with 2.1 seconds left to try to get the ball into the hands of a wide-open Jordan Morgan, who was fouled on the play. Morgan missed both of his attempts and was called for a technical foul, giving the Wolverines their first lead since the opening tip. ""It was a tough game for us,"" Spartans coach Tom Izzo said, ""but I thought we did a good job of staying in front of them."" Morgan finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds. He also had five assists and three steals. Ohio state led for most of that first half but couldn't get any closer than six points until the final minute. It was the third time this season that the two teams played to a scoreless tie, the other two being at Michigan on Jan. 28 and at Ohio on Feb. 3. After the teams traded baskets for the next two minutes, Morgan scored on a layup to give the OSU lead for good. That's when it was all over for Michigan, which lost its second straight game and dropped to 0-2 in conference play, its longest losing streak since a five-game skid from Dec. 31-Jan. 4, 2010. Michigan's next game is Saturday at home against No. 2 seed Wisconsin, a game that will be televised on ESPN2 at 7:30 p.m. (ET). ""I think we've got a lot of work to do,"" Morgan said.

The two countries are technically still at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, and the Korean Peninsula remains technically in a state of war. But the two Koreas have not had formal diplomatic relations since the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s, when the North's leader, Kim Il-sung, visited Washington for a summit with President Bill Clinton. Since then, North and South Korea have maintained separate embassies in each other's capitals, but relations have improved in recent years, with North Korean officials visiting the South for the first time in nearly 20 years in 2012. In recent months, however, there have been signs of a thawing of relations, including a visit by a delegation led by the country's vice foreign minister, Choe Ryong-hae, to the White House last month, where they met with senior officials from the State Department and National Security Council, according to a State Dept. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the visit. ""It's a very positive step,"" said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the trip and spoke to The Washington Post on condition that his name not be used. He added that the delegation's visit to Washington was ""very positive"" and that it was a ""positive step"" to improve relations between North Koreans and Americans. North-South relations are also at a low point, as Pyongyang has conducted a series of missile and nuclear tests in defiance of international sanctions and has threatened to conduct a sixth nuclear test. A senior administration official said last week that President Trump had spoken to Moon about his desire to restart the long-stalled six-party talks aimed at denuclearizing the peninsula, a move that would require China to take a more active role in brokering a solution. Trump is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month in Florida, along with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, in what would be a first-ever meeting between a sitting American president and a Chinese leader. On Monday, Trump tweeted that he had ""great confidence"" in Xi, whom he called ""a very good man."" ""I look very much forward to it,"" Trump said in an interview with Fox News's Bill O'Reilly that aired Monday night. Asked about Trump's tweet, Moon's spokesman, Cho Myoung-gyon, told reporters in Seoul on Tuesday that ""there is no change in our position"" on restarting the Six-Party Talks, which have failed to produce a breakthrough since they began in 2008. Cho said that Moon and Trump ""have a good relationship,"" but declined to comment on whether the president had discussed the issue with Moon during his meeting with the Chinese president. Moon has said he would like to resume the talks as soon as possible, though he has not said whether he will meet Trump in person or via video conference. During the presidential campaign, then-candidate Trump called for ""total and complete"" engagement with China, calling it the ""number one currency manipulator."" He has since softened his tone, saying he does not want to see China ""take advantage of us"" or ""begrudge"" American companies the profits that come from selling goods to China. China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular news briefing in Beijing on Monday that China is committed to maintaining peace and stability in Northeast Asia, adding that Beijing is willing to work with all parties to resolve the nuclear issue and other regional issues. However, he said, ""China will never allow any country to use its territory for military purposes or to threaten the security of China or its neighbors."" The United States and its allies have long accused China of using its economic leverage to exert pressure on other countries to change their behavior. Beijing has repeatedly denied such accusations and said it has no intention of seeking hegemony over the region. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Twitter that Trump and Moon ""should be more careful in their words and actions."" Lu said China has ""no intention"" of ""using its military might to impose its will on any other country."" In a separate statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: ""We urge all sides to exercise restraint and avoid any actions that could further escalate the situation. We hope the relevant parties will take the necessary measures to avoid further escalation of tensions and maintain stability and peace in northeast Asia."" A spokesman for Trump did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Kim, for his part, has made no secret of his determination to develop a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile capable of",0

7936,Researchers say birth control pill for men may soon be a reality,".Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) say they have developed a pill that can prevent sperm from fertilizing an egg. The pill, which has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), could be available as soon as next year, according to a study published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The pill works by blocking the action of a protein called FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), which is responsible for the development of male reproductive organs, including the testes, ovaries, and penis. When the hormone is blocked, the sperm are unable to fertilize the egg, leading to infertility in men who are infertile. In the study, researchers found that the pill reduced the number of sperm in a test tube by about 50 percent, compared with a control group that did not take the drug. They also found a significant reduction in sperm motility, or the speed at which sperm move through the tube. [10 Surprising Facts About Men]
...
""This is the first time that we've shown that a drug can block the ability of the male sex hormone to stimulate sperm production,"" study co-author Dr. Daniela Rus, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at UCSF, told Live Science in an email. ""It's a very important step forward in our understanding of how to prevent male infertility.""
 androgenic alopecia (AGA), also known as male pattern baldness (MPB), is a condition in which the hair follicles on the head and neck of men lose their ability to produce new hair. It can be caused by a variety of factors, such as a genetic mutation or a chemical imbalance, but it is most common in older men. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), an estimated 1.5 million men are affected by AGA worldwide, with the majority of cases occurring in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. There is no cure for AGA, although treatment can help reduce the frequency of hair loss and improve the quality of life for affected men, as well as their wives and children. However, there are no FDA-approved treatments for AGA, making it difficult for many men to find a doctor who is willing to prescribe them a medication to treat the condition. (For more information, see ""Male Pattern Baldness: What You Need to Know,"" at http://www.healthline.com/health/features/male-pattern-baldness-what-you-need-to-know.html.)

The theater, which is located in the Mission District, charges $15 for a single ticket and $20 for two tickets. ""It's ridiculous,"" the woman says. In order to pay for her tickets, she had to take out a loan from her parents, but that's not an option for many people in her situation.

The judge's order came in a lawsuit filed by the mother of the victim, who says her son was killed by a drug dealer who was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for the murder.
, the rapper, was released from a federal prison in Ohio last week. He was serving a life sentence after being convicted of first-degree murder in the death of 21-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014. His mother, Lesley McSpadden, sued the U.S. Bureau of Prisons and the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction for denying her request to have him released. She said she was told by prison officials that he was not eligible for parole because he had a prior conviction for armed robbery. But the judge said that wasn't true, and ordered him to be released immediately. ""The court finds that the defendant is a danger to the community and that his release is necessary to protect the public from the danger he poses,"" Judge Timothy Black wrote in his order released Friday. Black also ordered that a hearing be held to determine whether the federal government has the authority to keep him in custody.",0

The PA also accused the Israeli military of committing ""war crimes"" and ""crimes against peace"" during Operation Protective Edge, including the killing of more than 2,000 Palestinian civilians in Gaza, many of whom were killed in airstrikes and shelling by Israeli forces.
The PA said that Israel had violated the Geneva Conventions by targeting civilians and civilian objects, such as hospitals, schools, mosques and other civilian infrastructure. It also alleged that the IDF had used ""unlawful and disproportionate"" force against the civilian population of Gaza in violation of international humanitarian law (IHL) and international human rights law, particularly the laws of war and customary international law. In addition, it said, Israel was responsible for the deaths and injuries of hundreds of Palestinian children during the conflict, some of them as young as five years old, who were injured or killed as a result of Israeli attacks on their homes and schools.

3426,Global Industrial Potato Graders Market - Increase in Manual Labor Costs to Promote Growth,"The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the International Potato Research Institute (IPRI) recently released a report on the global potato grader market. The report found that the market for manual labor is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.5% from 2015 to 2023. This is the fastest rate of growth in the industry since the report was first published in 2000, and represents an increase of more than 50% over the previous five years.
According to the USDA and IPRI, the growth of the U.S. manual-labor market is driven by a number of factors, including the growing demand for high-quality potato products, increased automation of potato-processing operations, a shift from manual to computer-based processing of potatoes, as well as the increasing use of robots in potato processing operations. In addition, there is a growing trend toward automation in other agricultural sectors, such as dairy and poultry processing, which will further increase the need for labor in these sectors. Additionally, new technologies are being developed to improve the efficiency and productivity of farm labor. For example, robots are increasingly being used to assist farmers in harvesting and processing their crops. These robots can be used in a variety of ways, from picking up and moving the crop to moving it to a conveyor belt for further processing. As a result, farmers are now able to harvest and process more crops in less time and at lower cost than they could have previously, while also reducing the amount of labor required to do the same job on a larger scale.",0

The fruit is also high in fiber, which is important for maintaining a healthy digestive system. In addition, it is a good source for vitamin E and beta-carotene, both of which are associated with a lower risk of heart disease and cancer. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when choosing a berry. First, the fruit should be ripe, meaning that it has been fully ripened. This means that the flesh is soft and pliable, not hard and dry. Second, berries should not be picked before they are fully ripe. If the berries are picked too early, they will be very bitter and will not taste as good as they would if they were picked at the proper time. Third, if you choose to pick your berries, make sure that you pick them in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight, so that they do not dry out. Finally, you should only pick berries that are at least two weeks old, as older berries can be more bitter than younger ones.",0

In fact, he is the only player to have scored more goals than he did in his entire career, and he has done so in every country he's played in, including the United States, England, Germany, Spain, Italy, France, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru and Uruguay.
Thiago's career has taken him all over the world, but his home country of Brazil is where he made his name. The country has produced some of football's greatest players, with the likes of Pele, Ronaldinho, Roberto Carlos, Cafu and Ronaldo all making their mark on the national team. However, none of them were born in Rio de Janeiro, the city that is now known as the 'City of God' due to the number of people who have died from the Zika virus, which has been linked to microcephaly, a birth defect in which a baby is born with abnormally small head and brain size. It is estimated that there could be as many as 1.5 million cases of Zika-related birth defects across Brazil by the end of this year, according to a recent report by The World Health Organization (WHO). The virus has also been implicated in Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), a rare neurological disorder that affects the central nervous system and can lead to paralysis and even death.",0

 the mayor said he had asked London fire and emergency services to ""do all they can"" to help the victims and their families. He added that he was ""deeply saddened"" by what had happened and that his thoughts were with the families of those who had lost their lives. ""This is a terrible tragedy and our thoughts and prayers are with everyone who has lost a loved one in this terrible fire,"" he said. The fire broke out at the 24-storey tower block in north Kensington, west London, on Wednesday night. It is believed to have started in a boiler room and spread quickly through the building, engulfing a number of flats. Khan, who was elected mayor in May, has been criticised for his response to the tragedy, with some accusing him of being too slow to condemn the blaze and for failing to do enough to save the lives of people trapped inside. In his first public comments on the incident, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday morning that it was too early to say whether there had been a link to terrorism, but that there were ""a lot of questions that need to be answered"". He also said the government was doing all it could to find out what happened, adding that ""it's a very, very sad day for London"".

The study, published in the journal Obstetrical and Gynaecological Survey, found that women who have sex with women (MSW) have a higher risk of having a baby with a birth defect, such as anencephaly or cleft lip or palate, compared with those who do not have MSW. The risk was highest among women in their 20s and 30s, who had the highest rates of pregnancy-related birth defects, the study found. Among women with no history of sexual activity, there was no association between having had sexual intercourse with another woman during pregnancy and birth-defect risk, according to the researchers. ""This is the first study to show that having sexual contact with someone other than your partner during your pregnancy is associated with an increased risk,"" says lead study author Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts. He says the findings are consistent with other studies that have found a link between sexual behavior and a range of health problems, including diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and some types of cancer. However, he cautions that more research is needed to determine whether the association is causal, or whether it is due to other factors that could be influencing the women's health. For example, it's not clear whether having sex outside of marriage increases a woman's risk for having an abortion or miscarriage. In the United States, abortion is legal only in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in danger. But in many other countries around the world, abortions are illegal in all or most cases, even if the pregnancy results from rape or incest. A study published last year in The Lancet, which looked at data from more than 1.5 million women, also found an association with having multiple sexual partners, but it did not find a direct link to having babies with defects. That study was based on data collected from women between the ages of 15 and 44 who participated in a large-scale study of reproductive health in England and Wales. While the new study does not directly address the question of whether multiple sex partners are linked to a child's birth deformity, its findings suggest that it may be a possibility, says study co-author Prof. David King, an obstetrician-gynecologist at King's College London in London, England. King says he is not aware of any other study that has examined the relationship between multiple partners and defects in children born to mothers who are sexually active, although he notes that there is some evidence that the risk may increase with the number of partners a mother has had during her lifetime. Other studies have also shown that sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are more likely to be passed from mother to child during the course of a pregnancy, as well as through the placenta and umbilical cord during delivery. Some of these STDs can be transmitted through vaginal or anal sex, while others are passed through skin-to-skin contact. According to CDC statistics, about 1 in 5 women will contract an STD during their lifetime, with most of those infections",0

(Photo: Alessandra Tarantino, AP)The U.S. Geological Survey has issued a warning about the risk of volcanic eruptions in the western United States, including the possibility of a major eruption in California's San Andreas fault zone, according to a statement from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The warning comes after a series of earthquakes and aftershocks in recent weeks that have been linked to the region's active volcanoes, the agency said in a news release. The agency is urging people to be aware of their surroundings and to stay away from areas that are prone to volcanic activity. ""If you are in an area where you think you may be at risk for an eruption, be sure to check with your local emergency management agency,"" the NOAA statement said. In the statement, NOAA said it is not yet clear whether the recent earthquakes were caused by a volcanic eruption or a natural earthquake, but they are ""potentially significant"" and should be taken seriously by people who live in or near the area. NOAA also said people should take steps to protect themselves and their property from natural hazards, such as landslides and earthquakes, and that they should monitor local news and weather reports for information on the potential for a possible eruption. A magnitude-3.0 earthquake struck near San Jose, Calif., on Wednesday, prompting the evacuation of more than 100,000 people from their homes. It was the largest earthquake to hit the San Francisco Bay Area in nearly a century. On Thursday, a 4.3-magnitude quake struck off the coast of southern Chile, killing at least one person and injuring several others. And on Friday, an earthquake with a magnitude of 3.8 struck the Pacific Northwest, causing minor damage but no injuries or deaths in Washington state, Oregon, Idaho and British Columbia. Scientists have said that a large eruption of magma, or molten rock, beneath the surface of the Earth's crust could trigger a chain reaction that could lead to an explosive eruption similar to what happened at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming in 1872, when a volcano erupted and spewed millions of tons of ash and rock into the air.
""The risk is very real, especially in areas where there is a lot of human activity,"" said NOAA seismologist John Nielsen-Gammon, who is based at the University of Colorado in Boulder. He added that it's important to keep in mind that there are many factors that can affect the likelihood of an erupting volcano. For example, he said, there could be a change in weather patterns, which could make it more difficult for the volcano to erupt. There could also be an increase in seismic activity from nearby faults, as well as the movement of tectonic plates underneath the earth's surface. However, ""it's very difficult to predict exactly what's going to happen in any given year,"" he added. According to NOAA, earthquakes of magnitude 3 or greater are most likely to occur during the spring and summer months, while earthquakes with magnitudes of 2.5 or less are more likely during fall and winter months. If you or someone you know is in danger of being injured or killed by an explosion or other natural hazard, call 911 immediately. You can also call the American Red Cross at 1-800-RED-CROSS or visit their website at www.redcross.org/earthquake for more information. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2kvYxZy",0

1451,HPV test may be better than Pap smears at detecting early cervical cancer: Study,"Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women in the United States, after breast cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) estimates that 1.5 million women will be diagnosed with cancer of the cervix each year by 2040. However, the NCI does not have data on the prevalence of HPV infection at the time of diagnosis, so it is not possible to estimate the number of women who are infected with HPV at that time. In a study published in The Journal of Clinical Oncology, researchers from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) School of Medicine compared the results of a Pap smear with a HPV DNA test to determine whether the HPV test was more accurate in detecting HPV-positive cervical cancers than the Pap test alone. They found that HPV testing was significantly more likely to detect early-stage cancers, such as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), compared to Pap testing alone, even after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, alcohol consumption, family history of CIN or AIS, previous Pap tests, age at first sexual intercourse, number and duration of sexual partners, current use of oral contraceptives and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and cervical cytology results.

The universe was created by me, and I created it by my own power. It is my power that created all the living creatures. Therefore, it is not possible for me to be the cause of the death of any living creature. If I were to do so, then I would be responsible for the deaths of every living being. This is why I do not wish to cause any harm to anyone, even if that person is a human being or a non-human being."" (Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 1, Verse 1)
... The Lord is the All-Pervading, the Self-Subsisting. He is all-pervading and self-subsistent. (Sri Aurobindo, The Life and Death of Lord Krishna, p. 4)
The Vedas and the Upanishads are the only scriptures in the world that teach us about the nature of God. All other scriptures, including the Bible, say that God is an impersonal being who does not exist apart from Himself. In other words, there is no such thing as ""God"" or ""the God"" in any of these scriptures. There is only the Absolute Reality, or Brahman, which is identical with the Supreme Being. Thus, all other religions, such as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, etc., are false religions because they teach the existence of a God who is separate from His own Self. They also teach that there are many Gods, but none of them is God, nor is there any such entity as God as taught by the Vedic scriptures and Upanisads. These religions are all based on the false notion of ""gods"" and ""demigods"", which have no basis in reality. the Lord of this universe is called ""Brahman"" (or ""Sakti"") and is also known as Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma, Surya, Yama, Vayu, Bhairava, Kalki, Durga, Lakshmi, Parvati, Saraswati, Ganesha, Ganapati and many other names. His name is often translated as the ""One God"", but this term is misleading because the word ""god"" is derived from the root word for ""one"" which means ""to be one"". The term ""Goddess"" has also been used to refer to the Goddess of Love and Femininity, as well as to other Goddesses. However, these terms are misleading as they are not the same as those used in Sanskrit and other Indian languages. For example, in English, ""love"" refers to a person who loves another person, while ""femme fatale"" means a woman who seduces another woman. ""Feminine"" also has a different meaning than ""feminine"". In Sanskrit, a word is said to have a feminine meaning if it has the prefix ""na"" attached to it. A word with a masculine meaning has no prefix. So, when we say ""I love you"", we mean that we love the person we are talking about. Similarly, if someone says ""You are beautiful"", it means that he or she loves the object of his or her affection, not that she is beautiful in and of herself. When we talk about a Goddess, we don't mean the goddess of love and beauty. We are referring to her or him as a goddess because she or he is considered beautiful and desirable by other people. As a matter of fact, many people in India worship many different goddesses, some of whom are considered as gods, others as demigoddesses and some as other forms of divinities. Many people believe that the Hindu goddess Kali, who was the wife of King Ravana, is one such goddess. Some people also believe in a Hindu god called Shiva. Shiva is sometimes referred to as Shiva the Destroyer, because he destroyed the entire universe in order to create a paradise for himself and his followers. Other people, however, consider Shiva as one of many gods who are associated with various aspects of life and death, like the sun, moon, stars, rivers, mountains, trees, plants, animals, people and so on. Another important aspect of Hindu religion is that it teaches that all human beings are born into a state of ignorance, ignorance of their own true nature and that they must learn to know themselves and their true identity before they can be free from this ignorance and be able to live a happy and fulfilling life in this world.

3580,Macedonia: 8 million-year-old elephant-like remains found," in a cave in northern MacedoniaMongolia: 1.5 million years old mammoth remains discovered in the Altai Mountains of Mongolia
Burmese: 2.2 million year old remains of a mammoth found at the site of the ancient city of Kachin State in Burma. It is believed to be the oldest mammoth ever found. The discovery was made by a team of scientists from the University of Cambridge and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The remains were found during a dig at a site known as the 'Mammoth Cave', which dates back to the Late Pleistocene epoch, and are thought to have been part of an ancient herd of mammoths that roamed the region during the last Ice Age. They were discovered during an excavation project led by the Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, which was funded by China's National Natural Science Foundation (NSF) and supported by an NSF-funded project, the Mongolian Mammoth Conservation Project (MCCP), which aims to conserve the mammoth population in Mongolia. Researchers believe that the remains may have belonged to a female mammoth that died around 2,000 years ago and was buried with the rest of her herd. This is the first time that a mammoth has been found with a full set of tusks and teeth, as well as a complete skeleton, in such a state of preservation. 'This is a very important find for the study of early human evolution,' said the project's co-director, Professor David Reich, from Cambridge's Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, who is also a senior research fellow at Harvard University's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He added: 'The discovery of this mammoth is an important step towards understanding the evolution of modern humans and their relationship with other species of mammals, including the earliest known hominids.' The mammoth was discovered at an altitude of around 1,500 metres (4,200 feet) above sea level, making it one of only a handful of mammoth fossils found so far in North America, Europe, Asia and Africa. In addition to being the world's oldest known mammoth, it was also the largest of its kind, measuring more than two metres in length and weighing over a tonne. Scientists have long debated whether or not the animal was a male or female, with some researchers suggesting that it could be a hybrid between the male and female species, while others have suggested that",0

Mnuchin told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that ""we're still in the process of figuring out exactly what we're going to do with the individual side of it."" He added, ""I think we'll be able to come up with something pretty close to what the president has proposed.""

It would be implemented in phases, with the first phase starting in 2018 and the second phase beginning in 2019.
The plan is part of Cuomo's plan to reduce the state's greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2030, which he says will be achieved by reducing the number of cars on the road and increasing the use of public transit, biking and walking.

(Photo: KCNA, AFP/Getty Images) Story Highlights Malaysia's prime minister said the killing was a 'terrorist act' and 'a crime against humanity'
Malaysia's police chief said there was no evidence of foul play in the death of the North Korean leader's estranged half sister, Kim Kyong Hui, who was found dead in a hotel room in Malaysia on Monday
 the Malaysian government said it was looking into the circumstances surrounding Kim's death, but did not say whether it would seek to extradite her to face charges
.
, a Malaysian police official said Monday that Kim had been killed by a gunshot wound to the head. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the case. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak told reporters that the murder was ""a terrorist act"" and ""an act of war against the people of our country."" He added that he had spoken to his Chinese counterpart, Li Keqiang, and that they had agreed to work together to find the killers. ""We will do everything in our power to bring the perpetrators of this heinous crime to justice,"" he said, according to a statement from his office. He also said that Malaysia was working with the U.S. and South Korea to investigate the incident. Malaysia has been on high alert since the deadly bombing of a South Korean airliner over Ukraine in July, which killed all 298 people on board. It was the deadliest terrorist attack on Malaysian soil since 9/11, when a suicide bomber blew himself up on a crowded commuter train in central Bangkok, killing more than 200 people. In the days after the bombing, Malaysian authorities said they were investigating a possible link between the two attacks, though they have not said whether they believed the bombings were linked. Kim was born in Pyongyang in 1953 and had lived in China and Malaysia before moving to Macau, China, in 1997. She was married twice, first to Ri Jong Chol and then to Jang Song Thaek. Ri was executed in December 2013 after being convicted of corruption and abuse of power. His wife was sentenced to 15 years in prison in March 2014 for her role in his death.

(Photo: David McNew, Getty Images/iStockphoto)Buy PhotoLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Wednesday that the city will spend $1.5 million to build a floating raft that will be used to rescue people stranded in the river during the upcoming El Niño weather event, which is expected to bring heavy rains and flooding to Southern California and the nation's second-largest metropolitan area this winter season.
Garcetti made the announcement during a press conference at City Hall, where he was joined by Mayor Ed Lee and other city officials to announce the project. The city has already spent $500,000 on the raft, and it will cost about $2 million more to complete the work, according to a statement from the mayor's office. It's unclear how much of that money will go toward the construction of the floating structure, but it's likely to be a significant amount, given the amount of time and money that's already been spent on building the temporary rafts that have been used in recent years to help people get out of flooded areas.

 the $3.4 million in funding will come from federal and state grants, as well as private donations and donations from local businesses and organizations, the statement said. ""This is a great example of how we can work together to make a difference in people's lives,"" Lee said at the news conference, adding that he hopes the new raft will serve as a model for other cities to follow.The city is also planning to use the money to hire more people to assist with the rescue efforts, including people who have experience in rescue operations, such as firefighters, police officers, paramedics and lifeguards.Lee said he expects the number of rescues to increase as the weather warms up. He also said that people should be prepared for the possibility that they may not be able to get back to their homes in time to save their loved ones.""We've got to prepare for that possibility,"" he said, ""and we have to do it in a way that doesn't put people in harm's way.""The mayor also noted that there are more than 1 million people living in flood-prone areas across the country, many of whom are not prepared to deal with a major storm like the one that hit the East Coast in late October and early November.",0

2528,Senate bill would honor soldier who protected Jewish POWs," during World War IIWASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration (all times local):
5:30 p.m.
. The White House says the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in a lawsuit challenging the president's ban on travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. It's the first time the high court has heard arguments on the issue since the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the ban in late February, saying it violated the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law. Trump has said the travel ban is needed to protect the country from terrorism, but critics say it's a thinly veiled attempt to restrict Muslims from entering the United States. A federal judge in Seattle issued a nationwide temporary restraining order against the order in March, and a federal appeals court in San Francisco is considering whether to take up the case. In a statement, the Trump administration says it will ""vigorously defend"" its order and ""will continue to enforce the nation's immigration laws to ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles."" The president says he's ""very disappointed"" in the court's ruling, calling it a ""disgrace to our country and to the rule of law."" He says his order is ""not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion — this is about terror and keeping our nation safe."" Trump says, ""We are fighting hard for Merrick Garland, who I consider to be a very, very great man. I have great respect for the fact that he is being treated so unfairly by the Democrats. We'll see what happens with that. But we're going to continue our fight for him and for everybody else that's been affected by this horrible order that was put in place by a judge that is totally against us, against everything we are all about as Americans.""

6933,Forget Tough Passwords: New Guidelines Make It Simple," to Protect Your DataIf you've ever used a password manager like LastPass, 1Password, or Dashlane, you know how easy it can be to forget your password. The problem is, most of us don't have the time or the patience to go through all of our passwords every time we want to log in to a website or app. That's where a new set of guidelines from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) come into play. According to the DHS, the best way to protect your data is to use a strong password that's easy to remember, and that you can remember for the rest of your life. In other words, if you use the same password for everything you do online, it's going to be a lot harder for hackers to break into your account.
The new guidelines are part of a broader effort to make it easier for people to keep their personal information safe online. Last year, President Obama signed into law the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), a bill that allows companies to share information about cyberthreats with each other and with the federal government. CISA also gives companies the right to sell your personal data to third parties, including law enforcement and intelligence agencies, without having to get a warrant from a judge.",0

He's the son of Lonzo Ball, one of the best point guards in the NBA. The Ball family has been involved with the Lakers since the early '90s, when the team was known as the Los Angeles Lakers and the Ball brothers were playing for the L.A. Clippers.

Lonzo and his brother are currently playing in China, where they've been the subject of a lot of media attention. They've also been accused of being involved in a number of shady business deals, including the sale of their father's company to a Chinese conglomerate. LaVarr Ball has denied all of these allegations, saying that he has nothing to do with his son's business dealings.",0

The Buffs added a pair of runs in each of the next two innings to take a 6-3 lead into the fourth. CU scored four runs on five hits and two walks over the final four innings, including an RBI single by junior right fielder Nick Burdi to put runners on first and second with one out.
""It was a good start for us,"" CU head coach Mike MacIntyre said. ""We were able to get some good at-bats in and get a couple of good outs. I thought our bullpen did a great job of holding them to one run. It was good to see our offense get on the board. We had a chance to win the game, but we didn't get the job done. That's what we're going to have to work on. Our bullpen has to do a better job and we've got to find a way to score more runs. But overall, I think we were very good. There's a lot of things we can improve on, and that's something we'll be working on throughout the week and throughout spring training."" CU finished the day with a season-high eight hits, three of which went for extra bases (two doubles, one triple, two home runs) and three runs scored (three earned) in a 5-4 win over Oregon State on Saturday afternoon at Coors Field in Denver, Colorado. Freshman righty Jake Bauers (1.0 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 2 BB, 4 SO) earned the win in relief. Bausers allowed just one hit and one walk while striking out three in five innings of work.

In the loss, CU was held to just two hits on three hits by the Sun Devils, who scored five runs (four earned).

980,Canadian given five years' prison for aiding 2014 Yahoo hack,"A Canadian man has been sentenced to five-and-a-half years in prison in the United States for helping to orchestrate the 2014 breach of the Yahoo email account of a U.S. government contractor, the Department of Justice announced on Thursday. The man, identified only as ""John Doe,"" pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit unauthorized access to a protected computer, according to the Justice Department. He was sentenced in federal court in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. ""Today's sentence sends a strong message to those who would seek to harm our nation's most sensitive information,"" said Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell in a statement. John Doe is the first person to be prosecuted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), which was enacted in 1986 to protect computer users from computer fraud and abuse. Under the CFAA, it is a federal crime to access a computer without authorization and to use that access for the purpose of committing a crime, such as theft, fraud, or extortion. In this case, Doe was charged with aiding and abetting his co-conspirators in accessing the email accounts of Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor who leaked classified information about the agency's surveillance programs to The Guardian and The Washington Post in 2013. According to court documents, in June 2014, Snowden contacted Doe, who was living in Canada, and asked him to help him hack into Yahoo's email system. Snowden told Doe that he would provide him with a list of email addresses and passwords for Yahoo accounts, which he could then use to steal information from the company. Doe provided Snowden with the list in exchange for $50,000 in Bitcoin, an online currency that is not backed by any government or central bank and is used to buy and sell goods and services on the Internet. When the FBI began investigating the matter, they learned that Doe had been communicating with Snowden via the Bitcoin network. After learning of Doe's involvement in Snowden's hack, FBI agents executed a search warrant at his residence in Vancouver, Canada. During the search, agents seized computers, hard drives, thumb drives and other electronic storage devices, as well as a thumb drive that contained a copy of an email exchange between Snowden and Doe in which they discussed the hack and the amount of money they would be willing to pay to have the information stolen from Yahoo. At the time of his arrest, investigators also discovered that Snowden was using the same email address that was used by Doe to communicate with him. As part of their investigation, authorities also obtained a warrant to search the residence of Snowden in Moscow, Russia, where he is currently living under temporary asylum in order to determine if he has any information that could assist the government in its investigation. If Snowden is found in Russia and extradited, he faces charges of espionage and theft of government property, both of which carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.",0

5341,Serbia museum benefits from renewed interest in Nikola Tesla,"Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in the small Serbian town of Novi Sad. He was the son of a Serbian Orthodox priest. His father died when he was very young, and his mother remarried. Tesla's mother was a devout Christian, but he grew up in a household where religion was not an important part of the family's life. As a young man, Tesla became interested in electricity. In 1882, at the age of twenty-one, he began working as a telegraph operator in Belgrade, where he met his future wife, Svetlana Petrovna Nikolaevna Tesla. They had two children, a son and a daughter. After the death of his first wife in 1893, the Tesla family moved to the United States, settling in New York City. There Tesla worked as an electrical engineer for a number of companies, including the Edison Electric Illuminating Company and the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company. During this time he also began to develop his own ideas about the potential of electricity for the benefit of mankind. The Tesla Electric Light and Power Company was founded in 1901, with Tesla as its first president. It was in this company that Tesla developed the first practical alternating current (AC) power system for use in homes and businesses. This system, known as Tesla coil technology, was used to power the world's first commercial AC power plant, which was built at Wardenclyffe, New Jersey, in 1903. By the time Tesla died in 1943, his company had become the largest manufacturer of AC electric power systems in North America.",0
7375,Eurozone inflation falls despite buoyant economy,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has cut its key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a record low of 0.25 per cent, in a bid to boost inflation and boost growth in the eurozone.
In a statement on Wednesday, the ECB said it had decided to cut the deposit rate to minus 1.5 per euro from minus 2.0 per dollar, and to keep it at that level until the end of the year. The ECB also announced that it would buy €60bn of government bonds a month in an effort to push down borrowing costs and support the economy. It is the first time that the central bank has used quantitative easing (QE) since the financial crisis began in 2008, when it pumped billions of euros into the banking system to prop up the euro zone's struggling banks. In addition to the bond-buying programme, it has also cut interest rates on bank deposits by 25 basis points to -0.75 per annum, a move that is expected to have a significant impact on the cost of borrowing for savers. ""The ECB's decision to adopt a more accommodative stance of monetary policy is consistent with its mandate to maintain price stability,"" ECB president Mario Draghi said in his statement. He said the decision was also in line with the Bank of England's policy of keeping rates low to support growth. However, he added: ""We will continue to monitor developments closely and take appropriate action if necessary."" The decision is likely to be welcomed by the European Commission, which has been pushing for a rate cut for some time, as well as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is due to release its latest economic forecasts on Thursday. But it will also raise questions about the effectiveness of QE in boosting growth, given that inflation is still well below its target of just under 2% this year and is forecast to remain so for at least the next two years.
""This is a very welcome move,"" said Paul De Grauwe, chief economist at ING Bank in Frankfurt, adding that he was ""not sure"" the move would have much of an effect on inflation, but added that ""it's a positive step"". ""It's not going to make a huge difference to inflation,"" he said, ""but it's certainly a step forward in terms of reducing the risk of deflation."" But he warned that there was still a ""long way to go"" before inflation could return to its 2-3% target, saying that even if it did, that would still be ""a long way off"" from where it was at the start of 2014.",0

843,Youth Stage Mock Shooting Attack On Crowd At Movie Theater,"Enlarge this image toggle caption John Moore/Getty Images/Ikon Images JOHN MOORE/REUTERS/Landov John Moore / Getty Images / IKON Images
 I was at a movie theater in New York City on Friday night when a man in his 20s walked up to the front of the theater, pointed a gun at the screen and started shooting.
 the gunman, who was later identified as 26-year-old James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville, Ill., was shot and killed by an off-duty police officer who happened to be sitting in the same row as the shooter. The gunman died of his wounds at Bellevue Hospital Center in Washington, D.C., where he was being treated for a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to police and the Cook County medical examiner's office. He was identified by police as a white male, 5 feet 10 inches tall, with a medium build and a goatee. His name has not yet been released by law enforcement. Police say he had a long criminal record, including convictions for assault and battery, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and domestic violence. In addition, police say, he has a history of mental illness and had been involuntarily committed to a mental health facility several times in recent years. ""This was an act of pure evil,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters, adding that the shooting was ""an attack on the American way of life."" ""We are a nation of laws, and we will not be intimidated by those who seek to do us harm,"" he said in a statement. President Trump tweeted his condolences, saying, ""My prayers are with the victims and their families. This is a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant and why the safety of our citizens must always be my number one priority."" The shooting comes just days after a gunman opened fire on a Republican congressional baseball team practice in Alexandria, Va., killing House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and three others. That attack was also claimed by the so-called ""alt-right,"" a loosely organized group of white nationalists, white supremacists and anti-Semites who have been emboldened by Trump's election and his administration's efforts to roll back Obama-era policies on race and immigration. Trump has been criticized for not speaking out more forcefully against the group, which he called ""repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans."" In the wake of Friday's shooting, the White House said Trump had spoken with President Barack Obama and Vice President Mike Pence about the attack and offered his ""thoughts and prayers"" for the families of those killed and wounded. But the president did not call out the white supremacist groups by name, as he did after the deadly shooting in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Aug. 12, in which a car plowed into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one woman and injuring 19 others, many of whom were African-American. Instead, Trump said he condemned ""in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,"" and that ""racism is evil"" and ""must be condemned in all its very ugly forms."" He also said the U.S. is ""a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in every form."" On Saturday, a group calling itself the ""Unite the Right"" rally was scheduled to take place at Emancipation Park, where a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee was removed from its pedestal in August.",0

The summit is expected to focus on the crisis in Mali, where a French-led military intervention has failed to quell a rebellion by Tuareg separatists. Morocco is a key ally of Mali's government and has sent troops to support the Malian army in its fight against the rebels, who are backed by al-Qaeda-linked militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group. Algeria has also sent soldiers to Mali to help the government fight the Islamists. In the interview, the Moroccan leader also said he would not attend the UN General Assembly in New York in September, saying it would be ""unacceptable"" for him to attend a meeting of world leaders where the issue of Palestine is discussed. He added that he had no intention of resigning from his post as head of state, adding that the country was ""in a very difficult situation"" and that it was important for the international community to ""help us to find a way out of this situation"".

7278,"30 years later, Wall Street remembers 'Wall Street'","In the early 1990s, when the stock market was in free fall and the economy was on the brink of collapse, it was easy to forget that the financial crisis of the late 1980s and early '90s was the result of a series of events that began in the mid-1980s. The crisis began with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 1987, which was followed by the failure of Bear Stearns in October of that year. In the months that followed, the U.S. economy entered a period of rapid growth that lasted until the summer of 1989. But the economic recovery was short-lived, and by September of 1990 the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen by more than 1,000 points, to its lowest level since the Great Depression. By the end of September 1990, a total of $1.2 trillion had been wiped off the value of American financial assets. That same month, President George H.W. Bush signed into law the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), which created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to protect depositors from financial institutions that were too big to fail (TBTF). The GLBA was designed to prevent another financial meltdown like the one that occurred in 1929, but it also created a new set of rules for the banking industry, including a requirement that banks hold a certain percentage of their assets in cash and a limit on how much they could lend to one another. As a result, banks were required to hold more capital than they had before the law was passed. This meant that they would have to increase the amount of capital they held in order to meet the FDIC's capital requirements. Banks also had to make sure that their balance sheets were as liquid as possible, so that if one bank went under, other banks would be able to take its place. These new rules were intended to reduce the risk that a bank could fail and cause the entire financial system to go into a tailspin. However, they also made it more difficult for banks to lend money to each other, since they were no longer allowed to use their own deposits as collateral for loans. To make matters worse, these new regulations also required that all banks have a minimum capital of at least $50 billion, or $100 billion if the bank was a ""systemically important financial institution"" (SIFI). In other words, any bank that was deemed to be a systemic risk was subject to the same rules as any other bank, regardless of whether or not it had any assets of its own. It was at this point in time that many people began to realize that something was seriously wrong with our banking system. For example, during the first few months of 1992, there were a number of high-profile bank failures, such as Citibank and Bank of America, both of which were forced to file for bankruptcy protection. Then, in March of 1993, another major bank failure occurred, this time involving the failed savings and loan institution Countrywide Financial. At the time, most people thought that this was just another one of those ""too-big-to-fail"" banking scandals that had plagued the United States for decades. After all, what could possibly go wrong? But as time went on, more and more people started to notice that things were not quite as rosy as they first appeared. There were several reasons for this. First, as we all know, financial crises are often caused by a combination of factors that are outside the control of any individual bank or company. One of these factors, of course, is the fact that there are a lot of people out there who don't have the means to save for retirement or to buy a house or a car. Another factor that can cause a financial collapse is a lack of confidence among the people who own the money that is being lent to them. A third factor is that people tend to overspend on their credit cards and other forms of consumer debt. And a fourth factor can be summed up in one word: greed. When a person has too much money in his or her bank account, he or she is more likely to borrow money from other people and spend it on things that will make them feel better about themselves, rather than saving it for a rainy day. All of this leads to a situation in which the banks are in a position where they can borrow more money and lend it out at a much higher interest rate than it would cost them to actually buy the goods and services they are selling to their customers. If the interest rates on these loans are too high, then they will be unable to pay back the loans they have taken out, leaving them with even more debt to repay. Eventually, however, people will start to lose faith in their banks and begin to withdraw their money, leading to even greater financial problems. Finally, we can't forget about the",0

3541,Justices say foreign business can't be sued under 1700s law,"The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has upheld a lower court's ruling that foreign businesses cannot sue under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), a law passed in 1799 that gives the president the power to sue foreign governments for alleged violations of international law. The court ruled that the law is unconstitutional because it violates the Constitution's Commerce Clause, which gives Congress the authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and the First Amendment's Free Speech and Free Press Clauses. In a 2-1 decision, the court said the FSIA is ""unconstitutional as applied to foreign sovereigns."" The decision was written by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch. It is the latest in a string of rulings that have struck down the act, including one by the Supreme Court last year that said it was unconstitutional for Congress to pass a new law that made it a crime for a foreign government to violate the laws of the United States. ""The Court's decision today is a victory for our national security,"" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who sponsored the bill that passed the Senate and was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2006. He said he was ""pleased to see the Court reaffirm our nation's commitment to the rule of law."" ""It is clear that this law has no place in the 21st century,"" he said. Sen.-elect Jeff Flake of Arizona, who voted against the 2006 law, called the decision ""a major setback for American sovereignty and our ability to defend our interests around the world."" He added, ""I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that we have a strong and effective foreign policy that protects the American people and upholds our Constitution."" In the ruling, Chief Judge Roger Gregory wrote that Congress did not intend to give the executive branch a ""blank check"" to act as judge, jury and executioner on behalf of foreign countries. Instead, he wrote, Congress intended to ""provide the President with the tools necessary to carry out his constitutional responsibility to protect the nation from foreign aggression."" Gregory said that while Congress may not have intended it to be a blank check, it did intend that it would be used ""in a manner that is consistent with our constitutional system of checks and balances.""

2492,"PA: We want negotiations, not dictates",".JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, I wanted to ask you about the fact that, you know, the president of the United States, Donald Trump, has said that he wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, which is the largest trade agreement in the world. He's also said he's going to impose a 35 percent tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada. What do you make of that? What does that mean for the U.S. economy? And what does it say about your relationship with Mexico, with Canada, and with the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean, where you have a lot of businesses that are based in those countries, as well as in other countries in North and South America, such as Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Uruguay, Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Venezuela, etc.? What is your response to that kind of rhetoric, that you've heard from the Trump administration, particularly from Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who said, quote, ""We want to see a renegotiation of NAFTA. We don't want it to be as bad as it is right now."" What are your thoughts on the possibility of a renegotiated NAFTA that would be more favorable to American workers and to the American economy, but at the same time, would also be beneficial to your own country, Mexico in particular, in terms of trade and investment and so forth?
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: First of all, let me say that I think it's very important that we have strong trade agreements with all of our trading partners. That's why I voted against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, because I thought it was a bad deal for working families in this country. And I'm very concerned about what's happening in China. I've been very critical of China's trade practices. But I also believe that if we are serious about fighting climate change, we need to do it in a way that is fair to all countries and not just to China and other developing countries. So that's what I would do as president if I were elected president. The bottom line is, if you look at what we've done over the last 30 years, it has been a disastrous trade policy. It has cost us millions of decent-paying jobs, tens of thousands of factories have closed, millions have lost their manufacturing jobs and millions more have been forced into part-time work or have given up looking for work altogether. Now, there are some people who say, well, maybe we should have done a better job of negotiating the trade deals that were made during the Clinton administration. Maybe we could have gotten better deals for workers, for farmers and ranchers and small business owners. There are a number of things we can do to make it easier for people to get jobs in America. One of them is to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Another one is for us to pass the Employee Free Choice Act, so that workers have the right to join a union and bargain collectively for better wages, better benefits and better working conditions. A third thing is a tax on Wall Street speculation, a financial transaction tax, to break up the big banks and bring down the cost of capital for small and medium-sized businesses. All of these things are things that can make a real difference in people's lives. If we do them right, then we will be able to rebuild the middle class and make sure that every family has the chance to live in dignity and security and have access to health care and education and housing and all the other basic necessities of life.

5826,Longtime NPR host Ashbrook facing misconduct allegations,"Ashbrook, who has hosted NPR's ""All Things Considered"" and ""Fresh Air"" for more than two decades, has been accused of sexual misconduct by at least two women, according to a report in The Washington Post. The women say they were teenagers at the time of the alleged incidents, which occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and that they did not report the incidents to authorities because they didn't think they would be believed. One woman told The Post that she was 14 years old when she had sex with the host in a hotel room in New York City, while the other woman was 16 when Ashbrock allegedly groped her at a party in Los Angeles. Both women said they felt ""violated"" by their encounters with Ashbrack, but they decided not to go to the police because of their age and the fact that he was a well-known public figure. ""I felt like I had to keep my mouth shut,"" the 16-year-old told the Post, adding that the incident made her feel ""embarrassed and ashamed."" ""It's not something you want to talk about with your parents,"" she said. Ashbridg has denied the allegations. He has not responded to requests for comment from NPR. In a statement, NPR said, ""We are deeply troubled by these allegations and are taking them very seriously. We are committed to fostering a safe and respectful work environment for our employees and everyone involved in our newsgathering process."" Ashbridge is the latest high-profile figure to face allegations of misconduct in recent months. Last month, comedian Louis C.K. was fired from his eponymous show after multiple women accused him of making unwanted sexual advances toward them, including masturbating in front of them. And in October, actor Kevin Spacey was accused by actor Anthony Rapp of sexually assaulting him in 1986, when Rapp was just 14. (Spacey has since issued an apology and said he is taking a leave of absence from the Netflix series ""House of Cards"" to ""deal with this issue head-on."") In the wake of those allegations, a number of prominent men in entertainment, media and politics have been fired or forced to resign from their jobs.",0

It will be released in the second half of this year and is expected to bring a number of new features and improvements to the platform, including the ability to run Java applications on the JVM. This is a big deal for Java developers, as it will allow them to use the latest Java technology without having to worry about compatibility issues with older versions of Java. However, it is also a huge step forward in terms of performance and scalability, which will make it easier for developers to build scalable, high-performance applications that can run across a wide range of devices, from mobile devices to desktops, and from the cloud to on-premises environments. The new release will also bring support for the new JPA 2.1 specification, making it much easier to integrate with existing applications and frameworks. In this article, we will take a closer look at the major changes that will come with the release and how they will affect the way you develop and run your Java-based applications. We will start by looking at what is new in this release, followed by an overview of what you can expect to see in future releases. Before we get started, you should know that this is not a complete list of all the features that are included in Java SE 7, but rather a summary of those that have been announced so far.

The FDA has not yet responded to the request, but the agency is expected to make a decision on the drug within the next few months. Cephalosporins are among the most widely used antibiotics in medicine, and they are used to treat a wide range of infections, including pneumonia, sepsis and urinary tract infections. However, the use of these drugs has been linked to an increase in antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, particularly in hospitals and nursing homes, where the drugs are often used in combination with other antibiotics. In the United States, more than 1 million people are hospitalized each year for severe diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration, shock and death. According to data from the CDC's National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), the number of hospitalizations for C. Diff-related diarrhea increased from 1.4 million in 2000 to 2.2 million cases in 2010.

In a letter to the US ambassador to Nepal, Sher Bahadur Deuba, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the lack of action on the part of the Trump administration, which he described as a ""disgraceful"" breach of its commitment to ensure the safety and security of those in need of protection. The letter was signed by a number of senior government officials, including the interior minister, the foreign minister and the chief justice of Nepal's supreme court. It was addressed to a senior US official, who has been tasked with overseeing the resettlement of thousands of Nepali refugees from the war-ravaged country. ""I am deeply disappointed by your failure to fulfil your commitment,"" the letter said, adding that it had been made clear to US officials that they would be held accountable if they did not fulfil their obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol. Nepal is one of only three countries that have not signed the convention and has not ratified the 1967 protocol, meaning it is not legally bound to take in any refugees. In a statement, a US State Department spokesperson said: ""The US government is committed to protecting the rights of all refugees, regardless of where they come from, and we will continue to work with our partners to do so."" The US has pledged to resettle 1,250 refugees in Nepal over the next five years, but has so far only resettled a handful of them, most of whom are from Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Somalia.

Turkey is a member of the U.S.-led coalition against ISIL and has carried out a number of air strikes against the militant group in northern Syria.

The complaint says the relationship began when the victim was 14 years old and continued until she turned 18, when it was terminated.

7063,Feds seek 35 years for pharmacist in meningitis outbreak," Copyright by WCMH - All rights reserved VideoCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is seeking a 35-year prison term for a pharmacy technician who was convicted of infecting more than 100 patients with a rare and potentially fatal brain infection that killed one man and left another in a vegetative state, according to court records and a medical examiner's report obtained by The Associated Press. The case is the first of its kind to be prosecuted under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which allows the government to seek the harshest penalties possible for those who knowingly or recklessly expose others to a potentially life-threatening disease or injury. It also marks the second time in recent years that the FDA has sought a prison sentence for an employee in connection with an outbreak of an infectious disease. In that case, the employee was sentenced to five years in prison. A federal appeals court later overturned the sentence, saying it was too lenient, and the case was sent back to the district court for resentencing. ""This is a very, very serious case,"" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said at a news conference in Columbus, where he was joined by Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, who is leading the investigation into the outbreak. He said the agency is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal and state health officials to determine whether any other employees may have been involved in the spread of the disease, known as encephalomyelitis, or E.M.E., which is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis that is found in soil and water and can be transmitted by coughing, sneezing or sharing utensils or other contaminated surfaces. De Wine said it is too soon to know whether the other workers were also infected, but he said he is confident that they were not. His office is also investigating whether anyone else at the pharmacy was infected and whether they should be held accountable for their role in spreading the illness. Gottleib said there is no evidence that any of those employees had any direct contact with patients who were sickened by the bacteria. But he added that it's possible that some of them could have unknowingly spread the infection to other patients, even if they didn't know they had been exposed to it. That's because the patient who died had a weakened immune system and had not been vaccinated against the",0

2740,"Man who shot congressman was living in van, called a loner","A man who fatally shot Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., during a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Va., on Wednesday has been identified as James T. Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old resident of Belleville, Ill., according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation.
Hodgkinson was shot and killed by police after he opened fire on a crowd of Republicans practicing for a charity baseball game, the official said. He died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, according a statement from the Alexandria Police Department. The official spoke to The Associated Press on condition that he not be identified because of the ongoing investigation by the FBI and the U.S. Capitol Police, which is leading the probe into the June 14 shooting that left four people dead and more than a dozen others injured. Police have not released any information about a possible motive for the shooting, including whether it was politically motivated or an act of domestic terrorism. But they have said there is no evidence to suggest that the attack was a hate crime, and that they are treating it as a workplace violence incident. ""We have no reason to believe this was anything other than an isolated incident,"" said Alexandria police Chief Michael Brown in a news conference Wednesday afternoon, adding that investigators are still trying to determine whether the gunman acted alone or was part of any larger group.

,
The official told the AP that police found a rifle and a handgun at the scene, but did not say whether they were the same weapon used in Wednesday's shooting. It was unclear if the shooter had a criminal record or if he had any prior run-ins with the law. A neighbor, who asked not to be named because she feared for her safety, said she heard a loud bang and then saw a man running down the street with blood on his face. She said the man appeared to have a gun in his hand and was running toward the baseball field when she ran out of her house to see what was going on. When she saw police, she said, they told her to get back inside her home and lock the door. Another neighbor who also asked to remain anonymous said he heard the shots and ran outside with his wife and two young children. They said they saw two men running away with their hands in the air, one of them with a bloody face, while the other was holding a baseball bat. Both men were wearing baseball caps with ""Congressman Steve"" emblazoned across the front and were carrying baseball bats and baseball gloves. One of those men was later identified by authorities as Aaron Alexis, an Army veteran who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan and had been discharged in 2012. Alexis had worked as an IT specialist at a Washington, D.C., computer company, his LinkedIn profile shows. His wife, Sari, told The Washington Post that she was ""shocked and saddened"" by her husband's death and described him as ""a loving husband, father and grandfather."" ""He loved his job and his family,"" she wrote in an e-mail, ""and he will be sorely missed by all who knew him."" The FBI said Wednesday that it is working with local, state and federal authorities to investigate the incident and is offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction of anyone responsible for shooting at or injuring any member of Congress or their staff. In a separate statement, House Speaker Paul Ryan said: ""I am sickened by this despicable act. Let me be as clear as I can be. Violence of this kind has no place in our society and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, not citizens exercising their Second Amendment rights."" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called for Congress to hold hearings on gun violence and called on President Donald Trump to declare a national day of mourning. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy also said that Congress should hold a special session to address the issue. Trump, speaking to reporters at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., where he is attending the G-20 summit, also condemned the violence, calling it ""an attack on our freedom and our way of life."" He added that ""there's blame on both sides"" and said ""it's a horrible thing that's taken place.""

6027,"Blue Devils avenge only loss, beat Bears for district title","AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) — The Auburn Hills High School football team won its first state title in more than a decade, beating the Chicago Bears in the state championship game on Saturday night. The Tigers (9-3) beat the Bears (8-4) in front of a crowd of about 1,000 fans at the University of Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor. Auburn won the district championship for the second time in three years. ""It's been a long time coming, but it's finally here,"" said Auburn head coach Jim Leavitt, who has led the Tigers to back-to-back state titles in his first two seasons as the team's coach. He said he was proud of his team and the way it handled the pressure of being the No. 1 team in a state that has produced some of the best high school football players of all time. It was the first time Auburn had ever won a school-record nine straight state championships, and it marked the third straight year that Auburn has won at least 10 games in each of its last three seasons. In fact, Auburn is the only school in Michigan history to win nine consecutive district titles, according to the Michigan State Board of Regents, which oversees Michigan's public high schools. Auburn has also won eight straight district championships in football, basketball, baseball and softball, the last two of which were won by the Auburn Tigers in 2008 and 2009, respectively. This was Auburn's first-ever state-title game, as well as its fourth-straight state final appearance. After a scoreless first quarter in which Auburn scored just one touchdown, it took just three plays for Auburn to take a 7-0 lead on a 14-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Jake Rudock to running back D'haquille Williams on the game's opening drive. On the next Auburn drive, Williams ran for a first down on third-and-1, then scored a touchdown on fourth down to give Auburn a 17-7 lead. Williams finished the night with a career-high 4.5 yards per carry and a team-best 10 carries for 37 yards. Rudick completed 16 of 25 passes for 185 yards and two touchdowns. His first pass of that drive was a 13-play, 80-yards drive that ended with Rudocks' first career touchdown run. That was followed by a 10- play, 75- yard drive for an Auburn touchdown that was capped off by Williams' second career rushing touchdown to put Auburn up 21-14 with just over a minute left in regulation. But the Bear defense held on for its second straight win, holding the Tiger offense to a season-low three first downs and forcing a pair of Auburn punts that were returned for touchdowns, one to set up the final Auburn field goal and another to tie the score at 21 with less than two minutes to play in overtime. With Auburn leading 24-21 with 1:30 left, Rudicks threw a 16- and 17th-quarter touchdown passes to Williams to make it a one-possession game. Then, with the clock winding down and Auburn facing a fourth and goal from the 2-point line, quarterback Nick Marshall threw his second interception in as many games, setting up a game-tying field-goal attempt by Chicago. Marshall's second-half interception set the stage for Chicago to score the go-ahead touchdown with 2:10 left. Chicago's Nick Bosa scored on an 11-second run to cut the lead to 24 points with 3:45 left and put the victory out of reach. Boseko Lokombo, a senior defensive end from Chicago, finished with five tackles, including two for loss and one sack, while defensive tackle D.J. Johnson had three tackles and three quarterback hurries. For his part, Marshall said it was ""a great feeling"" to get the win after a tough first half that saw him throw two interceptions and be sacked three times. Still, he said, ""I didn't think we were going to be able to come back and win this game."" ""We had a lot of momentum going into the fourth quarter and we just couldn't find a way to finish it off,"" Marshall told The Associated Press by phone from Auburn, where he is attending the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis. ""(The Bears) are a very good team. They're a good defensive team, so we knew we had to do a better job of executing on offense. We did a great job."" The Bears were led by quarterback Jay Cutler (6-5, 220), who threw for three touchdowns and rushed for two more as he completed 22 of 33 passes (64.3 percent) for 292 yards with two scores and an interception. Running back Matt Forte (5-10, 215) had five catches for 80 yards, his third 100-plus yard game of",0

1723,"Derek Fisher proposes to Gloria Govan, ex-wife of Matt Barnes",", that the two of them get married.Gloria and Matt have been dating for a couple of years, and Derek has been trying to get her to move in with him, but she's not interested. Matt and Gloria get into an argument about it, which leads to Derek getting angry and threatening to break up with her. He then tells her that if she doesn't move out of the house, he's going to call the police on her and she'll be arrested for domestic violence. She tells him that she has a restraining order against him and that he has no right to threaten her like that. Derek then leaves, leaving Gloria with no choice but to leave Matt's house and move into her own apartment. Gloria then calls Matt to let him know that Derek is gone and to come pick her up. When Matt arrives at Gloria's apartment, she is surprised to see him there, as he was supposed to be at his sister's wedding. After a brief conversation with Matt, Gloria leaves the apartment and goes to her car, where she finds Derek's car parked in the driveway. As she drives away, Derek follows her, yelling at her for leaving his car in his driveway, to which she replies, ""I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't leave it in your driveway."" When Derek asks her what she meant by that, her reply is ""Well, I left it on the side of your street."" Derek, however, is not satisfied with that answer and continues to follow her as she gets into the car. Once inside, they begin to argue, with Derek threatening her with a gun and telling her not to tell anyone about what he did to Matt. While they are arguing, Matt walks in on them and sees Derek with his gun drawn on Gloria, who is holding a knife in her hand. The argument escalates when Derek threatens to kill Matt if he ever finds out that Matt is dating Gloria. At that moment, a police car pulls up in front of their apartment building and a man in a white police uniform walks up to them, telling them that they have a warrant for their arrest. They are then taken into custody and taken to a nearby police station for questioning. During their questioning, the officers ask Matt about Derek and he tells them about how he met Gloria and how they got into a fight at a bar and ended up breaking up after Matt told Derek that Gloria was cheating on him with another man. However, when Matt asks Derek why he would lie to him about his relationship with Gloria in order to keep Matt from finding out about their relationship, his response is that it was the only way he could protect himself from being found out. Later that night, at the precinct, officers are questioning Derek as to whether or not he told Matt the truth about the relationship he had with the woman he cheated on Matt with, or if Matt was lying about that as well. In the end, it is revealed that neither Derek nor Matt lied to each other, although Derek did tell Matt that there was another woman who was dating Matt at that time.",0

Atlanta police said in a statement that the gunman, identified by police as 26-year-old Emanuel Kidega Samson, was fired from his job as a cashier at the fast-food restaurant at about 11:30 p.m. Sunday. The statement did not say how long he had worked there or how many times he'd been there, but it did say that he ""had a history of mental health issues"" that led to his firing from the job. Police said they were still investigating the circumstances of the shooting, which they described as an ""isolated incident."" The restaurant was closed for the rest of Monday, and it was unclear whether it would reopen on Tuesday, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported, citing a restaurant manager who declined to give his name. ""It's a very sad day for us,"" the manager told the newspaper, adding, ""We're going to do everything we can to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else."" Police have not released the names of those who were injured or killed in the attack. They said the suspect was armed with an assault rifle and a handgun and was believed to have fired at least one shot at police before being shot and killed by a police officer. A witness told WSB-TV in Atlanta that she heard a ""pop, pop"" and saw a man with a gun in his hand. She said she then saw the man drop the gun and run away. In a news conference on Monday afternoon, Atlanta police Chief George Turner said that police had not yet determined a motive for Sunday's shooting. But he said it appeared to be an isolated incident and that there were no signs of a wider plot. He said police were looking into the possibility that Samson may have been inspired by the Islamic State militant group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, to carry out an attack like the one that killed 49 people in San Bernardino, Calif., in December. Turner also said there was no evidence to suggest the shooter was affiliated with any terrorist group or was on any kind of watch list. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed called the incident ""a senseless act of violence."" ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and all those affected by this tragedy,"" Reed said on Twitter.",0

The idea is to use a razor blade to cut a hole in the mattress to allow air to flow through it. This is done by applying a thin layer of foam to the surface of the bed. When the foam is wet, the air is forced through the hole, and when it dries, it is pulled back out. It is this process that creates the illusion of air movement in a mattress. In reality, there is no air flow at all, as the entire mattress is filled with air pressure. If you want to know more about this model and how it works, check out the video below.

Thousands of people were expected to attend the festival, which was organised by the nationalist Serbian Radical Party (SNS) and was due to take place on the outskirts of the city, but the event was disrupted by a small group of about 20 people, who threw firecrackers and stones at police and set up barricades in an attempt to prevent people from entering the venue.

It is the first time in history that an orbiting space station has been able to observe the entire Earth from such a high altitude, and it has provided a unique opportunity to study the effects of climate change on Earth's surface and atmosphere, as well as the impact of human activities on the environment.
The ISS is a joint project of NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Russian Federal Space Administration (Roscosmos). It was launched on April 24, 1998, from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and arrived at the ISS on September 5, 2010. Since its arrival, ISS has orbited Earth more than 6.5 million times, making it the longest-lasting human-made object in the Solar System. In addition to providing a platform for scientific research, it also serves as a test bed for new technologies and technologies that will be used in future space missions.

Cha Seung-woo, a professor of international relations at Seoul's Dongguk University, said he was not surprised by Park's decision to ask the United States to replace him, given that the two countries have been at odds over the North's nuclear and missile programs and the South's deployment of the THAAD anti-missile system in the western part of its border with North Korea, which has been criticized as a security threat by the Trump administration.The South Korean government has not yet made a decision on who will replace Cha, according to a ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak on the matter.Park's office said in a statement that Cha will continue to serve in his current position until the end of his term in 2018.Chao was appointed to his post by former President Roh Moo-hyun in 2013. He has served as an adviser to Park since the latter took office in late 2012.In his new role, he will be responsible for coordinating the government's response to North Korean provocations, as well as working with the international community to resolve the issue through dialogue and sanctions, the statement said.He will also play a key role in resolving the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, it added.BY KIM HYUN-JIN [kim.hyungjin@joongang.co.kr]",0

6552,London inferno extinguished; firefighters search for victims,"Firefighters are still searching for survivors after a massive fire ripped through a warehouse in central London on Saturday night, leaving at least 20 people dead and more than 100 injured.
The blaze broke out in the early hours of Saturday morning at the warehouse, which was being used as a storage facility for a number of high-end fashion brands, including Gucci, Burberry and Chanel, according to the London Fire Brigade (LFB), which is leading the investigation into the cause of the fire. The LFB said it was working with the Metropolitan police and the National Crime Agency (NCA) to establish the full extent of what caused the blaze. It was not immediately clear how many people were inside the building when it burst into flames, but it is believed to be the largest fire in London since the Grenfell Tower disaster in June.
.@LondonFire Brigade: ""We are working closely with @MetCC and @NCA to understand the causes of this fire."" pic.twitter.com/Y2x4QQj4Zv — London Ambulance Service (@LondonAmbulances) September 14, 2017
, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said in a statement. ""The FBU is deeply saddened by the loss of life and injuries caused by this tragic incident. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected and their families and friends,"" the union said, adding that it would be supporting the families of those who lost their lives.The fire was first reported at around 2.30am local time, when firefighters were called to reports of a fire on the second floor of an eight-storey building in Hackney, east London. Firefighters arrived to find a large plume of thick black smoke billowing from the roof, and were able to extinguish the flames before they could spread to other floors.Witnesses told the BBC that they heard a loud bang and then saw flames shooting up through the ceiling.One witness, who gave his name only as David, said he had been sleeping in his flat when he heard the alarm go off.He said: 'I was in bed and I heard this bang, then I saw smoke coming out of my window. I looked out the window and there was fire everywhere. 'There was a lot of smoke, so I went to get a smoke alarm and it went off.'He added that he saw a woman lying on a stretcher and a man with a head injury.David said the woman was screaming for help as she lay on her side, while the man was on his back with his head in her lap. He said that as he tried to help the injured man, he was hit by a piece of debris and fell down the stairs.Another witness told Sky News that she was sleeping when she heard what she thought was an explosion. She said she woke up to see a huge fireball coming from her flat.She described the scene as 'horrific' and said there were 'lots of bodies everywhere'.She added: '[There were] lots of people screaming and crying. There were people with burns all over their bodies and they were covered in soot.'She said firefighters had to fight their way through thick smoke and flames to reach the flat where she lives with her husband and two children, aged three and five.A spokesman for the Met Police said officers were investigating a ""major incident"" at a block of flats in Streatham, south-east London, in connection with an incident that happened on Friday night. A police spokesman said they had received a report of ""a fire at an address"" and that the incident was under investigation.",0

6595,"In Portugal, Drug Use Is Treated As A Medical Issue, Not A Crime","In the United States, drug use is treated as a medical issue, not a crime. In fact, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) defines drug abuse as ""any use of a controlled substance by a person who has not attained the age of 18 years, or who is under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the use, regardless of whether the substance is legal or illegal in the jurisdiction in which the person is using it."" In other words, if you're under 18, you can't use drugs. If you are 18 or older, however, it is perfectly legal for you to use any drug you want, as long as it's legal in your country of residence and you don't have a prescription for it. The same goes for alcohol, tobacco, and prescription drugs, which are all legal to possess and use in most countries around the world, including in Portugal. Portugal is one of only a handful of countries in Europe that have decriminalized the possession of all drugs (including marijuana) for personal use. This means that if a Portuguese citizen is caught with a small amount of marijuana, he or she will not be arrested, but instead will be given a warning and given the opportunity to pay a fine. It is important to note that Portugal's decriminalization of drug possession does not mean that drug users are no longer subject to the criminal justice system. They are still arrested and prosecuted for drug-related offenses, such as drug trafficking, possession with intent to distribute, etc. However, Portugal has made it much easier for people to get off the hook for their drug offenses. For example, under Portuguese law, a drug user can be sentenced to a maximum of three years in prison for a first-time offense, while a second offense will result in a minimum of six months in jail and a possible fine of up to $10,000.

The e-commerce giant is in the process of buying Whole Foods Market (NYSE:WFM) for $13.7 billion in cash and stock, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal (WSJ). The deal, which is expected to close by the end of the year, will give Amazon the ability to offer a wide range of health-related products and services to its customers, including health insurance, prescription drugs, home health services, and more. Amazon is also reportedly in talks to acquire a number of healthcare companies, such as Cigna Corp., Humana Inc., and Aetna Inc, as well as several medical device companies. In addition, the WSJ reports that Amazon plans to invest $5 billion over the next five years to expand its fulfillment center network and develop its own delivery service, Amazon Prime Now, to compete with traditional delivery services like UPS and FedEx. It's not clear how much of this investment will come from Amazon itself, but it's likely that the company will use the money to grow its business in other ways. For example, it could use some of its cash to buy back shares of stock to increase its stock price, or use it to pay dividends to shareholders.",0

(Photo: Andrew Francis Wallace/Toronto Star via Getty Images) Story Highlights The lights went out at the Empire State building in New York City at 9:30 p.m. ET Tuesday night. It was the first time the building had gone dark since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., that killed nearly 3,000 people.
The lights came back on about an hour and a half later, at about 10:15 p,m., but the lights remained off for about two hours after that, according to the city's Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DIT). The DIT did not immediately respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin. The city has not said how long it will take to restore power to all of the buildings in the downtown area. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which operates the subway system, said the agency is working with the City of Toronto to determine the best course of action. ""We are working closely with our partners to ensure the safety and security of our customers and employees,"" MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz said in an email to USA Today Network Wisconsin. He added that the MTA is ""continuing to monitor the situation closely and will provide updates as they become available."" The MTA said it is not aware of any other incidents in which the power has gone out for more than a couple of hours. In the past, power outages have been caused by natural disasters, such as Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and Hurricane Irene in 2011, as well as terrorism, including the attacks in Paris in November 2015, the Boston Marathon bombings in April 2013, and an attack on a subway train in Madrid on July 19, 2015. On Monday night, a gunman opened fire at an Orlando, Fla., nightclub, killing 49 people and injuring 53 others before he was killed in a shootout with police. At the time, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer called the attack ""an act of pure evil"" and urged people to stay away from the area, which is a popular tourist destination for tourists and locals alike. But the gunman, Omar Mateen, was a U.S. citizen who had been living in Florida for several years and was known to law enforcement officials. Orlando Police Chief John Mina told reporters Monday evening that authorities were still trying to piece together the shooter's motives, but that he appeared to be a ""lone wolf"" with no ties to any terrorist group. Minala said he had no reason to believe the shooting was related to terrorism or any type of extremist ideology.
.@OrlandoPolice chief says shooter was ""a loner"" who ""had no connections"" to terrorist groups. — NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) June 12, 2016 The attack came less than two weeks after the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, when a lone gunman killed 49 and injured 53 people at Pulse nightclub in Orlando. That attack was carried out by a 29-year-old man from Fort Pierce, Florida, who pledged allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi before opening fire inside the gay nightclub. Police have said they are investigating whether the Orlando shooter acted alone or was part of a larger terrorist cell. Omar Mir Seddique, 29, has been charged with one count of using a weapon of mass destruction and two counts of assault with a deadly weapon. His bond was set at $1 million. According to court records, he has a history of mental health issues and is being held in lieu of $2.5 million bail. Authorities have not released the names of those killed or injured in Tuesday's attack. More than 100 people were inside Pulse when it was struck by the gunfire, authorities said. Officials said there was no immediate indication that anyone else was injured or killed during the incident. One witness told NBC News that she heard a loud bang and then saw a flash of light. She said she ran outside to see what had happened and found a man lying on top of another man, with blood on his face and body. Another witness said that when she arrived, she saw people running out of Pulse, some with their hands over their heads, while others were screaming and crying. Witnesses described a chaotic scene as people tried to flee the club, many of them hiding under tables and chairs. They described seeing people lying in pools of blood and being carried away on stretchers. Some people who were injured were taken to area hospitals, where they were being treated for gunshot wounds and other injuries, officials said, adding that there were no reports of anyone being shot by police or other emergency personnel. There were also reports that some people had barricaded themselves inside a nearby",0

The first women to win the men's marathon were both women. They were the two-year-old daughters of a Boston police officer, who had been a runner in her youth. Their father, a police captain, had trained for years to become a professional marathon runner, but he never made it to the finish line. When he died, his daughters were able to complete their father's dream of becoming a world-class runner.

4059,Study: Federal utility shifts costs to residential customers,"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for a rule that would require utilities to shift costs from residential and small business customers to large commercial and industrial customers. The NPRM is expected to be published in the Federal Register by the end of the year. This is the first time that the FERC has issued such a proposal, and it will likely be challenged in court. In the meantime, here's what you need to know about the proposal and the legal challenges that could come from it.
What is a ""transmission fee"" and what does it mean for residential, small-business and large-commercial customers alike? A transmission fee is an extra charge that utilities charge to customers for the transmission of electricity from one point to another. For example, a utility might charge a residential customer $1.50 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) to transmit electricity to a business customer. A large business might pay $2.00 per kWh to do the same thing. These transmission fees are often referred to as ""net metering"" fees because they are charged to all customers, regardless of whether they use more or less electricity than the utility charges them to use. Transmission fees can be used to offset the costs of building and maintaining transmission lines, as well as to pay for other costs associated with the operation of a transmission line, such as the cost of maintaining the line itself. They are also used by utilities as a way to raise revenue from customers who do not use all of their electricity, or who use a lot of it but are not paying their fair share of transmission costs. When a customer uses more power than their utility is charging them for, the customer pays the difference between the amount of power they actually use and how much they were charged for that power. (For more information, see ""Net Metering: What It Is, How It Works and What You Can Do About It"" in this fact sheet from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).) The FCC's proposal would change the rules for how utilities are allowed to charge for transmission services. Under current rules, utilities can charge customers up to $0.10 per kWh for transmitting electricity. However, under the proposed new rule, these fees would be capped at a maximum of $3.25 per KWh, which is less than what the average residential consumer pays for electricity in most states. Utilities would also be",0

A Russian violinist who came out as gay last year has become the first openly gay man to perform in a major Russian orchestra, the state-run TASS news agency reports. The musician, who has not been named, is a member of the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra, which is based in the city of St. Petersburg and is one of Russia's most prestigious orchestras. His performance will be broadcast live on the orchestra's website and on its Facebook page, and it will also be streamed on YouTube and other social media platforms, according to the news service. ""I am proud to be a part of this orchestra,"" the musician said in an interview with the Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, adding that he hopes to inspire other gay musicians to come out, as well as other Russian musicians who may be struggling with their sexuality. He told the newspaper that his coming out was not a political statement, but rather a personal one, saying, ""It was a decision that I had to make for myself. I am not ashamed of it. It is not something I have to hide from anyone."" The news of his performance comes as Russia continues to grapple with a series of high-profile cases of anti-gay violence, including the murder of a gay rights activist in Moscow last month and the brutal beating of two gay men in Volgograd last week. Earlier this month, a Moscow court sentenced two men to three years in prison on charges of ""aggravated homosexuality"" after they were found guilty of having sex outside of marriage. And earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law banning ""propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations"" to minors.",0

4149,"Israeli police arrest tycoon, others in bribery, fraud sting","JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli police say they have arrested a businessman and two others on suspicion of bribery and fraud in a corruption probe that has rocked the country's largest construction company. The arrests were announced Friday by police in the southern city of Beersheba, which is home to the world's third-largest settlement of Jewish settlers. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the suspects were arrested in connection with a bribery investigation that began last year. He did not identify the businessmen or say how much money they were accused of taking in bribes. A lawyer for one of the men was not immediately available for comment. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the arrests a ""major blow"" to Israel's economy. ""This is a major blow to our economy,"" he said. Netanyahu said he was ""deeply shocked"" by the allegations and called for a thorough investigation into the matter. Israel has been rocked by a series of high-profile corruption scandals in recent years, including allegations that the prime minister's son-in-law received millions of shekels in kickbacks from a construction firm in exchange for helping the firm win government contracts. In a separate case, police said Friday that they had arrested the son of a former cabinet minister and his wife on charges of fraud and money laundering. They were detained at their home in an upscale neighborhood of Tel Aviv, where the couple lives with their two children, a police spokesman told The Associated Press. No charges have been filed against them, and the case remains under investigation, the spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to release the information. Earlier this month, Netanyahu's office announced that he had ordered a probe into allegations of corruption at the state-owned Israel Electric Corporation, or IEC, after the company's chief executive was arrested on corruption charges. That investigation is still ongoing, according to a person familiar with the investigation who spoke anonymously because the probe is ongoing. It's not the first time that Netanyahu has taken a hard line against corruption in Israel. Last year, he ordered the closure of dozens of companies suspected of being involved in corruption, saying they posed a threat to national security.",0

474,Hello world!,"Now that you have a basic understanding of how to build a web application, let's take a look at some of the more advanced features of ASP.NET MVC. The first thing you'll want to do is create a new project in Visual Studio. If you haven't already done so, you can do so by clicking the ""New Project"" button in the upper right-hand corner of this page. You'll be asked to name the project, and then click ""Next"" to continue with the wizard. Once you've finished creating your project and clicked ""Finish"", you should see something similar to the image below.
If you don't see the above image, then you may need to install the Visual C++ Redistributable Package (x86 or x64) or the.NET Framework 4.5.1 Update 1 (32 or 64-bit) for your operating system. After you install these packages, open up a command prompt and type the following command: ""msbuild myproject.csproj"" (without the quotes). This command will create the folder ""myproject"" in your current directory. Now that we have our project created, we're ready to start building our application. To do this, type ""dotnet new webapp"" into the command line and press enter. This will open a wizard that will guide you through the creation of your first web app. When you're done, press ""OK"" and you will be presented with a screen that looks like the one below (click on the picture to enlarge it).:) Now it's time to get started building your application! To start off, click on ""Start"" at the top-right corner and select ""Web Application"" from the drop-down menu. A new window will pop-up asking you if you'd like to create an empty project. Click ""Create Empty Project"". You will then be prompted to select a name for the application and a folder to put it in. In this example, I'm going to call my application ""MyWebApp"". Now, the next step is to add some code to your web.config file. Open up the file in a text editor (I'm using Notepad++ for this tutorial, but you could use any editor you like) and add the code below into it. <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?> <configuration xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xsi:schemaLocation="" http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"" > <System.Data.SqlClient>... <Data Source=""MyData"" ConnectionString=""Server=localhost;Database=MyDatabase;Integrated Security=SSPI;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;Initial Catalog=WebApplication"" />... </Data> </Configuration> You should end up with something like this. Note that I've added the connection string and the database name, as well as the Integrated Security setting. These settings will allow you to connect to a SQL Server database, which is what we'll use to store our data. We'll also add a few other settings, such as whether or not to use a secure connection, so that only authorized users can access the data stored in our database. Next up is the actual application code. Create a file called ""Main.cshtml"" inside the directory you just created. Inside of that file, add this code: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.01 Transitional//EN"" ""http: //www. w3. org /TR /xhtml 1. 01 /dtd /elements/text/html;charset=iso-8859-1"" /><html lang=""en"" dir=""ltr""><head><meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text / html; charset = utf - 8 "" /> <title>My Web Application</title><script src=""main.js""></script><link rel=""shortcut icon"" type=""image/svg+xml"" href=""../images/logo.png"" media=""(min-width: 600px)""> <style> body { background-color: white; color: black; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0 auto; padding: 10px; } #main { position: absolute; top: 50%; left: -50%; width: 100%; height: 200%; } </style></head> The above code will set the background color of our page to white, position the main element at 50% of its width, set its height to",0

The sun's corona, the outermost layer of its atmosphere, is so bright that it can be seen with the naked eye from Earth. But it's not just a sight to behold. It's also an opportunity to learn more about our home planet and the universe in general. And that's exactly what NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) has been doing for more than a decade.
The sun has an enormous magnetic field that protects it from solar wind, a stream of charged particles that can damage satellites and interfere with radio and television signals. SDO, however, can detect and track these particles, allowing scientists to study them in greater detail than ever before. In fact, it was the first space observatory to be able to observe the coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that are responsible for most of Earth's space weather, including solar flares, solar storms, and geomagnetic storms. By studying these events, scientists hope to gain a better understanding of what causes them and how to prevent them from happening again.",0

Smog has blanketed Beijing, the capital of China, for the first time in more than a decade. The city has been shrouded in a thick haze since Monday, when a fire broke out in the city's coal-fired power plant, which is responsible for about a quarter of all the nation's greenhouse gas emissions, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The fire was quickly put out, but the haze has lingered for days, and the air quality index (AQI) — a measure of pollution's impact on human health — has reached hazardous levels in some areas.

He was also fined $50,000 and banned from competing in the UFC for two years. McGregor's positive test came after he was knocked out by Nate Diaz at UFC 196 in July 2016, and he appealed the suspension to the NAC, which ultimately upheld the decision. The UFC has yet to make a decision on whether or not McGregor will be allowed to return to action in time for UFC 200 on July 9 in Las Vegas, but he is expected to be back in action at some point during the year. In the meantime, he will have to sit out the remainder of the 2016-17 season of ""The Ultimate Fighter: Latin America,"" which is set to air on FS1 and UFC Fight Pass, as well as the 2017-18 and 2018-19 seasons of that reality show, according to a report from MMAFighting.com's Ariel Helwani on Wednesday's edition of The MMA Hour (www.mmajunkie. com/the-mmahour), which was streamed live on UFC.tv.

939,Greens push for broader copyright ‘safe harbour’ provisions,"The Australian Greens have called on the Federal Government to introduce a broader safe harbour scheme for online copyright infringement, which they say would protect the rights of online service providers from liability for copyright infringements committed by their users.
In a submission to the Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2015, the Greens say that the current safe harbor scheme is too narrow, and that it does not adequately address the needs of the online industry. The Greens also argue that there is a lack of clarity around what constitutes an infringement of copyright by a user of a service provider's website, or by an individual user accessing a website from a third party's computer or mobile device. They also point out that existing safe harbors do not provide adequate protection for users of services providers' websites from being held liable for the actions of third parties who use their services. This is particularly the case when it comes to online services that allow users to upload and share copyrighted content, such as music, movies, television shows, software and software applications, as well as websites that host such content. In these cases, it is the user's responsibility to ensure that their content is not being used in a way that infringes the copyright owner's rights. For example, if a person uploads a song to a music website and then shares it with a friend, that person is responsible for that friend's use of that song, even if the song was not created by the person who uploaded it. However, in cases where users upload content to websites hosted on third-party computers and mobile devices, they may not be held responsible if their actions infringe on copyright owners' rights, because they are not directly involved in creating the content or distributing it to others. As a result, users are often not aware that they have infringed copyright when they share content on a site hosted by someone else. Furthermore, there are no provisions in existing copyright law to protect users from having their online activities monitored by copyright holders, who may be able to use the information they gather about their activities to pursue legal action against them. These issues are particularly relevant in the digital world, where the vast majority of internet users access the internet through a computer, mobile phone or tablet, rather than a desktop or laptop computer. It is also important to note that, under current law, a copyright holder can seek a court order to monitor the activities of an internet user, regardless of whether or not that user is actually infringing copyright. Under the Safe Harbour scheme, this would be possible, but it would require the court to first obtain a warrant from the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), which would then have to be approved by both the Attorney-General and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade before it could be carried out. There are also concerns about the extent to which the ACMA would have the power to carry out such an order, given its role as a regulator of telecommunications services and internet services in Australia. A number of other countries, including the United Kingdom and New Zealand, have introduced legislation that would provide greater protection to users who upload copyright-infringing material to their websites. While these countries have not yet implemented the legislation in full, some have already made significant progress in this area, while others have yet to do so. Australia is currently the only G20 country without such a scheme in place.",0

2393,Rouhani urges Palestinian unity after Jerusalem recognition,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday urged Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to form a unity government with his Fatah movement, which has ruled the West Bank and Gaza since the late 1970s, in a bid to end the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian deadlock. The comments came a day after Abbas said he would recognize Israel as a Jewish state, a move that would be the first by a Palestinian leader in more than a decade. Abbas, who has been in exile in the United States since 2007, is seeking to revive the stalled peace process with Israel that collapsed in April 2014. ""I urge the Palestinian leadership to unite with the Islamic Resistance Movement (IRM) and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) in order to bring about the establishment of a new Palestinian state based on the principles of the two-state solution, based upon the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, and in accordance with international law and international resolutions,"" Khamene' said in an address to a gathering of Islamic scholars in Tehran, according to the semi-official Fars news agency. He did not elaborate on what he meant by the term ""two state solution."" The Islamic Republic has long opposed the creation of an independent state of its own, saying it would lead to chaos and bloodshed. Khamane' also said that ""the Palestinian people have the right to return to their homeland"" and that the ""Palestinian people should be given the opportunity to live in peace and security in their own homeland."" He also called for a ""national dialogue"" between the Palestinians and Israelis. In a separate speech, Abbas called on Israelis and Palestinians to reach a peace deal by year's end and said his government was ready to work with any party to achieve that goal. But he also warned that any deal would have to be ""based on two states for two peoples"" — a reference to Israel and Palestine — and not ""one state for one people."" ""We will not accept any agreement that does not include the return of all refugees and their descendants,"" he said, adding that he was willing to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss the issue. A senior Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press that Abbas' comments were ""unhelpful"" to efforts to restart peace talks. Netanyahu's government has said it is not interested in restarting talks with Abbas and is instead focused on pushing ahead with construction of Jewish settlements on land Palestinians want for their future state. Israel captured the Gaza Strip from Jordan in 1967 and later annexed it. It withdrew from Gaza in 2005, but has continued to control the territory's airspace and seaport, as well as the eastern seaboard, where it maintains a large military base. Palestinians seek a state in all of historic Palestine, from the Jordan River to Jerusalem, along the lines of what existed before Israel's creation in 1948.",0

If you would help me, I would gladly give you some of my money, but I don't know what to do with it. What do you think I should do if I were to give it to you? I can't even buy a loaf of bread, let alone a bag of rice. You would have to take it from me and sell it for a lot of money. How would you do that? You wouldn't be able to find a place where you could buy rice for less than a dollar a kilo. That is why I want you to come with me to my house. There you will find some rice and some other things that will make you very happy. It will be a great help to me if you can give me some money for my expenses. But you mustn't tell anyone about it, or I won't let you go.""
The next day, when he went to his house, he found that it was empty. He went back to the house of the man who had given him the money and asked him what had happened to him. The man told him that he had been taken away by the lepers and that they had taken him to another place, where he was to be killed. When he heard this, the beggar was very angry and said: ""If you are going to kill a man, you should have done it a long time ago. Why did you wait until now? Why didn't you kill him when you had the chance?"" The other man said that the time had come for him and his family to leave the country, for they were too poor to live there any longer. They had no money to pay for the food they needed, so they would be forced to sell their possessions and go into exile in another country. Then he would give them a chance to return to their own country and live in peace. ""I will go with you and help you,"" said he. So they set out together, carrying their bags of food with them. On the way, they met a woman who told them that she had a son who was sick and could not live on his own. She asked them if they could take care of her son, as she was a very poor woman and would not have the means to care for her own son. As soon as they got to her house they took her into their house and gave her some food and a little money in order to make her comfortable. After a few days they came back and told her that their son had died. Her heart was broken and she began to weep bitterly. At that moment, she heard a voice calling her from the other side of a wall, telling her to get up and come out to see what was going on. A man came out from behind the wall with a knife in his hand and cut off the head of his son and threw it into the river. This was the first time that anyone had ever done such a thing in the history of mankind. In the following days, people came from all over the world to visit the dead body of their dead relatives. Some of them took the body and buried it in a shallow grave, while others dug up the grave and carried it away to a new place of burial. Many of these people had never seen a dead person before, nor had they ever heard of anything like this happening before. All of this happened because the people of that country were so poor that there was no way for them to support themselves and their families. And now, after all these years, there were still people living there who did not even know about the existence of leprosy, much less how to help the poor people who were suffering from this terrible disease. One day a group of people from a neighboring country came to meet them and offered them some kind of help, which they gladly accepted. These people were called the ""Lebanese,"" because they lived in Lebanon, a small country on the Mediterranean coast of North Africa. Their country was rich in gold and silver mines and also in oil and other natural resources that could be used for trade with other countries. However, because of its small size and the fact that its population was so small, it had to rely on its own resources to provide for itself and its people. For this reason, Lebanon was known as a ""poor man's country."" The Lebanese people, however, were not satisfied with this situation and they wanted to improve their situation. Therefore, one day they decided to set up a trading post at the foot of Mount Ararat, near the city of Sidon, to serve as an outlet for all the trade goods that",0

In a report released on Wednesday, the human rights group said the EU had failed to take any action to protect children from abuse by Libyan authorities. The report also said that EU member states had not taken any steps to ensure the protection of children in Libyan detention centres, despite the fact that they were obliged to do so under international law. It also accused EU states of failing to investigate allegations of child abuse and of not taking action against those responsible for such abuse. ""The EU's failure to act on these serious allegations is a serious breach of its obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),"" the report said. In a statement, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said she was ""deeply concerned"" by Amnesty's findings and called for an urgent investigation into the allegations. She said: ""I am deeply concerned by this report, which raises serious concerns about the treatment of asylum seekers and migrants in Italy and elsewhere in Europe, and calls for a thorough and independent investigation of these allegations."" The EU has been criticised for not doing enough to stop the flow of migrants and refugees into Europe from Libya, where more than 2,000 people have died trying to reach Europe this year.",0

.@DukeBlueDevils have lost 11 straight games and are now 0-4 on the road this season. pic.twitter.com/qjZ4q6Qj9z — ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) March 23, 2017
 the Blue Devil's offense has been a big part of the team's success. Duke has scored at least 100 points in all but one of its last 10 games. In fact, Duke is the only team in the country to have scored 100 or more points against every opponent it's played this year. That's not to say that Duke's defense hasn't played a role in its success, as it ranks second in points allowed per game and third in field goal percentage allowed. However, it has struggled to stop opponents from getting to the free throw line, which has led to a lot of easy baskets for the Duke offense. It has allowed opponents to shoot 50 percent or better from the charity stripe in 11 of 12 games this month, and it will need to do a better job of limiting opponents' free throws if it wants to get back into the win column.",0

The Wildcats were led by senior point guard De'Aaron Fox, who scored a career-high 31 points and grabbed 11 rebounds. Fox was the only player to score in double figures for the Wildcats, as they shot a season-low 40 percent from the field. Kentucky shot just 38 percent overall, but made up for it with a 41 percent shooting from 3-point range. It was Fox's first game back from a knee injury that kept him out of last week's win over North Carolina, and he finished with 15 points, five rebounds and four assists.

756,#StandWithKeaton Hashtag Aims To Start Nationwide Conversation On Bullying," In SchoolsA group of high school students in New York City have launched a campaign to raise awareness about bullying in schools. The campaign, called ""Stand With Kenny,"" aims to start a nationwide conversation on the issue of bullying and encourage students to talk about it with their teachers and school administrators. ""Bullying is a problem that affects all of us, and we need to work together to stop it,"" the group said in a press release.
The campaign is being spearheaded by students at Stuyvesant High School in the Bronx, who are calling on their peers to stand with Kenny, a 14-year-old boy who has been bullied since he was a child. Kenny is the son of the school's principal and has a history of being bullied by other students. He has also been the victim of physical violence, including being hit with a baseball bat and having his head slammed into a wall, according to a report from the Daily News. In response to Kenny's bullying, the students have started a petition on Change.org, which has garnered more than 1,000 signatures. It reads, in part, ""Kenny, you are not alone. There are thousands of other kids like you who feel the same way you do. We want you to know that we are here for you and that you have the power to make a difference in your life."" The petition also includes a video of Kenny talking about the bullying he has faced.",0

Sekuler said he had ""no further comment at this time."" Manafort's attorney, Kevin Downing, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The special counsel, Robert Mueller, is leading the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election. Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates, have been indicted on 12 counts, including conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agent of a foreign principal, false and misleading Foreign Agents Registration Act statements and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts. Mueller's team is also looking into the finances of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn was fired by Trump in February after just 24 days on the job for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of his conversations with Kislyak before Trump took office. Trump has denied any collusion with Russia and has called the probe a ""witch hunt.""",0

A court in the southern Turkish city of Antalya has begun the first trial in connection with the July 15, 2016, attack on a popular nightclub in which 39 people were killed and more than 100 were injured.The trial, which is expected to last several months, will focus on the role played by a group of people who were detained after the attack. The suspects are accused of being part of a terrorist organization and of having links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade-long insurgency against the Turkish state.According to prosecutors, the suspects were members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C), an outlawed Kurdish militant group that has been waging an insurgency in southeastern Turkey since the 1980s. They are also suspected of involvement in a number of other terrorist attacks in Turkey, including a suicide bombing at a police station in Ankara in July 2016 that killed 10 people and a car bomb attack at Istanbul's Atatürk Airport in October 2015 that left 32 people dead.In addition, prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for the group's leader, Fethullah Gülen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999.",0

It is used by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). It has been in use since the late 1970s and is considered to be one of the best climate models available. The model is run on a computer that is connected to a global network of weather stations. This network is known as the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN), which is made up of more than 1,000 stations around the world. These stations are used to calibrate the model so that it is as accurate as possible in its predictions of future climate change. In addition to the global model, there are also regional models that are run at a local level in each country. For example, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) runs a regional model in the UK, while the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) has a model for the eastern United States. Each of these models has its own strengths and weaknesses, but they all have the same goal: to predict the future behavior of Earth's climate in a way that will be useful to decision-makers.",0

2909,Russian opposition journalist Arkady Babchenko is alive. His assassination was staged. Ukraine arrested the assassin,".Babchenko was shot in the back of the head at point-blank range by a sniper while he was sitting in his car outside his home in Kiev, Ukraine, on February 22, 2014. He died a few hours later at a hospital. The assassin, who was later identified as Andriy Parubiy, was arrested and charged with murder. However, the charges were later dropped, and he is now in jail awaiting trial on charges of embezzlement and money-laundering, according to the Associated Press (AP) and the BBC (BBC). The BBC reports that Parubsiy is being held in a Kiev prison, where he has been denied access to a lawyer and has not been allowed to see his wife and children since his arrest. According to AP and BBC, he faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted on all charges, which would make him the first person to be convicted of murder in Ukraine since the country's independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
The BBC reported that the murder was carried out by two men, one of whom was a former member of parliament who had been arrested in connection with an investigation into corruption. A third man was also arrested, but has since been released and is believed to have been involved in other corruption investigations. It is not clear if the three men are related, or if they were acting independently of one another. In any case, it is clear that this was not a random act of violence. This is the second assassination of a prominent Ukrainian politician in less than a year, following the death of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko in February 2014, when she was stabbed to death in her prison cell by her former bodyguard, Yuriy Lutsenko. She was the daughter of ex-President Leonid Kuchma, a close ally of Ukraine's current President Petro Poroshenko. Her death was widely seen as a political assassination orchestrated by the former president's political rival, former prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk.",0

5394,EEC Expands Power Source Lines with Feature-Rich 6300 and 6500 Series," Power SuppliesToday, the European Commission (EC) announced that it has approved two new power supply lines that will be used to expand the power source lines (PSLs) in the EU. These new lines will allow for the expansion of the existing power sources in Europe, which will help to reduce CO2 emissions and improve energy security for consumers and businesses.
The European Union (EU) is the world's largest energy consumer, with a total energy consumption of more than 1.2 trillion kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year. The EU is also the largest consumer of electricity, accounting for about one-third of global electricity consumption. As a result, Europe's power sector is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, as well as to air pollution and climate change. In order to address these issues, EU member states have been working to increase the use of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, and to improve the energy efficiency of buildings and transport. To do so, they have adopted a number of measures, including the Renewable Energy Directive (REN) and the Energy Efficiency Directive, both of which were adopted in 2007 and 2008, respectively. However, these measures have not been sufficient to meet the increasing demand for electricity. This has led to the need for additional measures to be taken to ensure that Europe continues to have access to reliable, affordable and clean energy, while at the same time reducing the environmental impact of its energy use and emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants. For this reason, in 2010 the Commission launched the ""Powering Europe"" initiative, aimed at improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of power generation and distribution systems in EU Member States. Today's approval of two additional PSL lines is an important step towards achieving this goal. ""The Commission's decision to approve these two lines demonstrates that we are on the right track in our efforts to make Europe more energy efficient,"" said Maroš Šefčovič, Vice-President for Energy Union, Energy Security and Energy Democracy, at a press conference in Brussels. He added: ""We are now in a position to take the next steps towards our goal of reducing emissions by at least 40% from 1990 levels by 2020. We are also on track to achieve our objective of increasing the share of non-fossil fuels in electricity generation to 20% by 2030."" The two power lines approved today are part of",0

681,Dogs Might Be Able To Sniff Out Some Forms Of Cancer,"A new study suggests that dogs might be able to sniff out some forms of cancer. The study, published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), was conducted by a team of researchers from the University of California, Davis, and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Bethesda, Md., and was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). The researchers tested the ability of dogs to detect the presence of various cancer-causing agents in urine samples. They found that the dogs could detect a wide range of carcinogens, including benzene, toluene and formaldehyde, as well as a variety of non-carcinogenic compounds, such as acetone, ethyl acetate and propylene glycol. In addition, the researchers found a significant correlation between the amount of a particular carcinogen detected in a dog's urine and how long the dog had been exposed to the agent. For example, dogs that were exposed for a long period of time to a high concentration of benzaldehyde in their urine were more likely to be diagnosed with bladder cancer than dogs who were not exposed long enough to develop the disease.
The researchers also tested a number of other carcinogenic agents and found they were also detectable in dogs' urine. These include benzyl alcohol, benzophenone-3, benzo[a]pyrene, bisphenol A (BPA) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which are used as flame retardants in many consumer products and are known to cause reproductive and developmental problems in humans and other animals. However, these chemicals are not found in human urine, so it is not known whether they can be detected by dogs in this way. It is also unknown whether the detection of these substances in dog urine could be used to predict the risk of developing certain types of cancers.",0

Monson, right, speak during a news conference at the Church Office Building in Salt Lake City. (Photo: Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News, via AP) Story Highlights The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints says it will not participate in a plan to manage the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Utah Department of Natural Resources.
The Church says the plan is not in the best interests of Native American tribes, who are concerned about the impact of mining and oil and gas development on their sacred sites. The plan would allow the federal government to sell the land to the private sector, which would then manage it for the benefit of the general public, according to a statement from the church's Missionary Department.
 the LDS church says in its statement that it is ""deeply troubled"" by a proposal to transfer management of some federal lands to private interests. ""The proposed transfer of management responsibilities from federal agencies to non-federal entities will have a profound negative impact on Native Americans and other Americans,"" the statement says.

3019,Mind the gap,"!The gap between the rich and the poor is widening. The richest 1% of Americans now own more wealth than the bottom 90% combined, according to a new report from the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), a left-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C. That's up from less than one-third of the wealth held by the top 0.1% in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the report found.
... The report also found that the share of national income going to the richest 10% has more than doubled since 1979, from 12.5% to 22.4%.
Income inequality has been rising for decades, but it has accelerated in recent years. Between 1979 and 2007, income inequality increased by about 1.2 percentage points per year. Since then, it's grown at an average annual rate of about 2.3 points. In other words, over the past 30 years, incomes have grown faster for the wealthiest Americans than they have for everyone else. And that trend is likely to continue. According to an analysis of Census Bureau data by Emmanuel Saez, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, and Thomas Piketty, a French economist, in his best-selling book, ""Capital In The Twenty-First Century,"" the incomes of top earners have risen at a faster rate than those of middle- and lower-income Americans since the early 1990s.",0

However, it was too little, too late as the goal was negated by a goaltender interference penalty on Pittsburgh's Olli Maatta. It was the second time in as many games that a Rangers player was penalized for interference, as defenseman Ryan McDonagh was given a five-minute misconduct for a high-sticking penalty against the Philadelphia Flyers on Feb. 25. Mcdonagh has been suspended for two games by the NHL for his hit on Flyers forward Wayne Simmonds during the first period of a game on Jan. 31. Maata was also given an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for an elbow on Penguins defenseman Kris Letang during a second-period faceoff in Pittsburgh on March 4.",0

""It's not a pleasant smell, but it's strong enough to make you want to run away from it. It's like the smell of rotting eggs or sewage on a hot summer day."" [The Strangest Alien Planets]
The study, which was published in the journal Nature Geoscience, was conducted by a team of researchers from the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the Netherlands. The team used the Hubble Space Telescope to look at the planet's atmosphere, looking for signs of methane, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and carbon dioxide. They also looked for the presence of sulfur dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of fossil fuels, as well as sulfuric acid, an odorless, colorless gas that's produced when sulfur reacts with water. (Sulfur dioxide is produced by volcanoes on Earth, for example.) The researchers also measured the amount of light reflected off the surface, to see if there was any evidence of water vapor or clouds of dust or ice on the moon's surface. Finally, the team looked at how the atmosphere reacted to ultraviolet light, using a technique called spectroscopy. This allowed the researchers to determine how much methane and other gases were being produced and how they were reacting to the light. [Photos: The Most Alien Places on Our Solar System (Gallery)]
. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/UCLA/MPS/DLR/IDA/SSC/IRAP/LAM/IAA/NSF/Univ. of Arizona/Goddard Space Flight Center/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (Phys.org) —Astrophysicists have discovered that the gas giant Neptune has an unpleasant odor that makes it difficult for humans to smell it, according to a new study published today (Sept. 22) in Science.The team, led by researchers at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., used Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) to study the atmospheres of Neptune and its moon Triton, both of which orbit around the giant planet Neptune. These two planets are so close to each other that they are only a few hundred miles (800 kilometers) apart, making them very similar in size and composition. In fact, they're so similar that scientists have nicknamed them ""Neptune's twin.""The researchers found that Neptune's smell is stronger than that of other gas giants, such as Jupiter and Saturn. However, it is not as strong as those of Mars, Mercury, Venus and Mars' moon, Phobos. For example, Neptune is about 10 times stronger in its smell than Mars is, while Mercury and Venus smell about the same as Mars.In addition to its strong odor, scientists also found evidence for methane on Neptune, suggesting that this gas may be a key component of its atmosphere. Methane is a greenhouse gas, meaning it traps heat and increases the Earth's albedo, or reflectivity, by reflecting sunlight back into space. Scientists have long suspected that methane could play a role in making Neptune a more hospitable place for life to exist.However, until now, no one had been able to detect the odor of this methane-producing gas on any planet other than Earth. To find out if it could be found on other planets, researchers used a combination of Hubble and ground-based telescopes, including the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT), which is located in Chile's Atacama Desert.Using the VLT's Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on board the telescope, astronomers found the faintest emission they had ever seen from a planet outside of Earth — about one-thousandth the brightness of a full moon. That's about as faint as you can get without the help of an instrument called a spectrograph.Astronomers then used data from Hubble to measure the distance to Neptune using the Doppler effect. By measuring the time it takes light to travel from one place to another, this technique allows astronomers to calculate how far away a given object is from its host star. Using this method, Hubble found Neptune to be about 1,000 times farther away than previously thought.This finding is important because it suggests that there are at least two different types of gases that are produced on planets around other stars. One type of gas is known as ""planetary nebula gas"" and is made up of hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, water",0

The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation. Kushner is expected to be questioned about his contacts with Russian officials during the campaign and transition, the person said. A spokesman for the committee did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Trump has repeatedly denied that his campaign colluded with Russia, and he has dismissed as ""fake news"" reports that he fired FBI Director James Comey because of the bureau's investigation of possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Comey has testified that Trump asked him to end the FBI's probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was forced to resign in February after it was revealed he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of his conversations with Sergey Kislyak, Russia's ambassador to the U.S. During his testimony, Comey said Trump told him, ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to getting rid of all of these people. He was very angry at me because he thought I was going to let it go."" Comey also said he believed the president was referring to him when he said ""this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story."" Trump fired Comey on May 9, after he refused to pledge his loyalty to Trump during a private dinner at the White House.",0

""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,"" Trump said in a statement from his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he is vacationing with his family. Trump's comments came hours after a Virginia state police officer was fatally shot and another injured in clashes between white nationalists and anti-racism protesters. The president, who has been criticized for his slow response to the violence, also said that ""many sides"" were to blame for the clashes, which left one woman dead and more than a dozen injured. He said the ""alt-left"" — a term he has used to describe the far-right — was also responsible for violence at the rally, but he stopped short of calling them ""extremists"" or ""white supremacists."" ""Racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, Neo-Nazi and other hate groups that are repulsive to everything we hold dear as Americans,"" he said. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Saturday that the president ""condemns all forms of violence and bigotry in any form."" She added, ""The president has made it very clear that this is not a time for political correctness."" Trump has faced criticism for failing to immediately condemn white nationalist groups and their leader, former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, during his first week in office. In a series of tweets Saturday morning, Trump called Duke a ""very fine man"" who ""totally disavowed"" his support for Trump during a CNN interview earlier this week. On Friday, Duke said Trump ""should be ashamed of himself"" for not immediately denouncing Duke's support.

(Photo: Scott Olson, Getty Images/iStockphoto) Story Highlights The pipeline would cross under Lake Oahe, a tributary of the Missouri River, near the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation. The tribe says the pipeline threatens its water supply.
A federal judge last week denied a request for a temporary restraining order to stop the project, saying the tribe had not shown it would be irreparably harmed by the construction. A federal appeals court is expected to rule on the matter in the coming weeks, and a final decision could come as early as this summer.

4093,Rates on US Treasury bills slip from 8-year high,"The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade on Wednesday, as the US economy continues to recover from the worst recession since the Great Depression. The US central bank will also keep its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 0.25% for a second time this year, according to a Reuters poll of economists.
""The Fed is likely to hike rates at its next meeting, which is scheduled for December 15-16,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""It will be interesting to see how the Fed responds to the recovery, and whether it will raise rates more aggressively than it has in the past, or whether the economy will continue to improve and the unemployment rate will fall further."" The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which meets every six months, will decide whether to keep rates unchanged or raise them by a quarter of a percentage point each time it meets in December. It has not raised rates since December 2008, when it cut them to near zero in a bid to support the global financial system. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said she expects the rate hike to be ""gradual and gradual"" and will not be a ""one-off event"". The last time rates were raised by more than one-quarter point was in March 2009, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. In the wake of the financial crisis, Fed officials have repeatedly said they expect the jobless rate to fall to 6.5% by the end of 2015, from 7.1% at the start of 2014. But the latest jobs report, released on Friday, showed that the number of people out of work for 27 weeks or more rose to an 11-month high of 5.9 million in October, the longest stretch of joblessness since records began in 1976.

The settlement, which is to be built on privately owned Palestinian land, will be the first of its kind in more than a decade.
 the Jerusalem Post reports (http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Jerusalem-Supreme-Court-settles-lawsuit-over-boundary-dispute-14096) that the court's decision to grant the settlers' request for a preliminary injunction to halt construction on the land is a victory for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing Likud party.

1786,Merck Alzheimer's drug fails in 1 study; another continues," to show promise(NaturalNews) A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) has found that a drug that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) does not work as well as previously thought.The study, conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the National Institute on Aging (NIA) in Bethesda, Maryland, looked at data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that tested the efficacy and safety of a new drug called rivastigmine in patients with PD. The study was designed to test the drug's ability to slow the progression of PD, which is characterized by a progressive loss of motor control and is the leading cause of death in people over the age of 65.According to the researchers, the results of this study suggest that the FDA-approved drug may not be as effective as originally thought, and that further research is needed to better understand the mechanism of action and potential side effects.In the study's first phase, patients were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or a daily dose of 1,000 mg of rifampicin, an anti-PD medication that has been used for decades to treat the disease. In phase two, participants were randomized to either receive the same treatment as in phase one, or to continue taking the medication for a longer period of time.Results showed that patients who received the placebo did not show any improvement in their PD symptoms, while those who were given the daily treatment showed a significant reduction in symptoms. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of overall disease progression or the number of patients that developed a serious adverse event, such as a stroke or heart attack.Researchers also noted that there was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between patients in both groups.However, in a separate analysis of data collected from the phase three trial, researchers were able to find a statistically significantly higher rate of adverse events among the patients receiving the active drug compared to those receiving placebo. These included an increase in blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, fatigue, anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts, among others.These findings are consistent with previous studies that have found a higher incidence of cardiovascular events, including heart attacks, strokes and heart failure among patients treated with this drug, according to a press release issued by UCSF and NIA.""The results from this phase 3 trial are encouraging, but further studies are needed in order to determine whether this medication is safe and effective for PD,"" said Dr. David J. Saperstein, director of clinical research and clinical programs at UCSD's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), who was not involved in this research. ""We need to understand more about the mechanisms by which this treatment works and how it might be used to improve the quality of life for patients.""In addition to this new research, a second study has also been published this week in JAMA. This study examined the safety and efficacy of two drugs that are currently being tested in clinical trials. One of these drugs, riluzole, is being developed by Pfizer as part of its ongoing efforts to develop a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a disease that affects millions of people around the world. It is also being investigated for its potential use in treating other types of autoimmune diseases, like multiple sclerosis (MS).The other drug being studied is rituximab, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). This drug is currently undergoing a Phase 2 trial to see if it can help people with relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS), an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs.",0

6950,Why Future Earthlings Won't See Total Solar Eclipses,"""""The Sun is not the only source of energy in the universe. There are many other sources, such as the Earth's magnetic field, the Sun's corona, and the planets' magnetic fields. All of these energy sources interact with each other and with the solar wind, which is the flow of charged particles from the sun into space. The sun is a very active star, but it is also the most massive star in our galaxy. It has a lot of mass, so it has the potential to produce a large amount of solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are powerful bursts of radiation that can damage satellites and power grids. However, we don't expect to see as much solar flare activity as we did during the last solar maximum, when there were many more CME events than there are now. This is due to a number of factors, including the fact that solar activity has been decreasing over the past few years, as well as our ability to observe it more closely. We also expect that the next solar minimum will be less intense than the one that occurred in 2010, because of a decrease in sunspots and a decline in solar magnetic activity. In addition, there is no evidence that we are on the cusp of another major solar cycle, or that it will occur any time soon. So, if you are a future Earthling, you won't see a total solar eclipse in your lifetime.""",0

In a report published on Tuesday, the International Crisis Group (ICG) said it had found evidence that the Emirati government had been involved in a ""systematic campaign of bribery and kickbacks"" in order to secure funding for the UN mission in CAR, known as MINUSCA. The ICG, which is based in Washington, DC, said the UAE had paid $1.5m (£1m) in bribes to UN officials, including a senior UN official, in return for access to the country's oil and gas resources. It also alleged that UAE officials had used their influence to influence the appointment of two UN peacekeepers to CAR in 2011 and 2012, as well as the awarding of lucrative contracts to a company owned by a UAE-based businessman. ""The UAE has a long and sordid history of corruption and bribery in Africa,"" the report said, adding that it was ""not surprising"" that a country with such a history would seek to use its influence with the international community to gain a financial advantage over its neighbours. In a statement, UAE foreign ministry spokesman Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum said: ""We are not aware of this report and have no knowledge of it. We are fully committed to fighting corruption in all its forms and will continue to do so."" The report was based on interviews with more than 100 people, most of whom were former or current UN staff, who had worked on the CAR mission between 2009 and 2013.
...
It is not the first time that Qatar has come under fire for its alleged links to corruption. Last year, Qatar's foreign minister, Khalid bin Mohammed Al Attiyah, was forced to resign after it emerged that he had accepted a $2m bribe from a Qatari businessman to help secure a contract to build a luxury hotel in Doha.

The indictment was handed down by the court's public prosecution department. YCT head Rabbi Shmuel Eliyahu, who is also the dean of the school, is accused of encouraging students to carry out acts of violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, according to the report. In the indictment, prosecutors said that the rabbi encouraged students at his school to attack Palestinians, including by throwing rocks and firebombs at them, and that he also encouraged them to throw Molotov cocktails at Palestinian homes and businesses. ""Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef's actions are a clear and present danger to public order and the security of Israeli citizens,"" the prosecution said in a statement, adding that ""the court has decided to indict him on the charge of inciting violence."" The court also ordered the confiscation of his property, which it said was worth more than $100,000 at the current exchange rate. A spokesman for the Public Prosecution said the case had been transferred to a higher court, but did not provide further details. According to court documents, Rabbi Yehudah Glick was arrested in September 2015 and charged with inciting the public to commit violence. He was released on bail in January 2016, after the High Court of Justice rejected his appeal against the decision to detain him.",0

The Lions were beaten by England in the semi-finals of last season's tournament, and were also knocked out at the quarter-final stage by Australia in their opening match of this season., who has been sidelined with a knee injury, is set to return to the starting line-up after missing the last two games with an ankle injury. He is expected to start on the left wing, where he has started all but one of his Lions appearances since joining the club in 2015.The backline is unchanged from last week, with the only notable change being the inclusion of hooker Ben Morgan (hamstring), who made his first appearance of 2017 in last weekend's win over the Waratahs.Morgan is the first Lion to make his debut for his new club, having joined from the Crusaders in 2016, but he is unlikely to feature in this week's match. Morgan's inclusion is likely to come as a surprise to many Lions fans, given that he was a regular starter in his time at Newlands and has played a key role in helping the team to back-to-back Grand Slams in 2013 and 2014.In the front-row, the most notable changes are the return of lock Ben Youngs (knee) from injury and the addition of back rower Sam Tomkins (ankle).Tomkins has missed the past two Lions matches after picking up a hamstring injury in training on Friday, while his replacement, lock James Haskell, has not played since suffering a shoulder injury during a training session on Monday.Tommy Bowe",0

The series will mark the first time the two teams have met since the Falcons defeated the Bearcats, 5-2, in the second game of a doubleheader on Sept. 22, 2015. Bowling green won that game, 3-0, and has won the last four meetings between the teams.

 the series is the third of the season for the Buckeyes, who have won four of their last five games and are in position to win the American Athletic Conference regular-season title and earn a spot in College World Series play. Cincinnati is currently ranked No. 1 in both the Associated Press and USA Today Coaches' Polls and is one of just three teams in Division I baseball with a winning percentage of.500 or better.The Falcons are coming off a season in which they finished the regular season with an 8-5 record and advanced to the NCAA Tournament for a second straight year.

He also has a school-record 22 doubles this season and ranks second among all Division 1 baseball players with 15 stolen bases.Odowski is hitting.333 with four homers, 15 RBI and a 1.087 OPS in his last 15 games, while also leading the Big East in hitting, runs, hits, doubles, RBI, walks, stolen-bases and slugged-percentage.

""I call on all parties to the conflict to immediately and unconditionally release all political prisoners,"" Ban said in an interview with the BBC's Newshour programme broadcast on Thursday. He added that he had been in contact with his French counterpart, Laurent Fabius, about the situation in Guinea and that they had agreed to work together to find a political solution. The UN has been trying to broker a peace deal between the two sides for months, but has so far been unable to reach an agreement. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the UN said it had received reports of ""unrest"" in the capital, Conakry, and in several other towns and cities. It said the reports were ""credible"" and called for an immediate end to violence and the release of all prisoners. A spokesman for the president of Guinea, Jose Eduardo dos Santos, told the AFP news agency: ""We are not going to negotiate with terrorists. We will not allow them to take over our country."" He also said that his government was ready to discuss the possibility of a ceasefire with opposition groups. But he said there was no point in talks if the opposition did not stop its attacks on the security forces. UN peacekeeping chief Herve Ladsous said last week that peace talks in neighbouring Sierra Leone had failed to produce a lasting peace agreement and urged the international community to step up efforts to bring the warring parties together. Guinea is one of Africa's poorest countries, with a per capita income of less than $2 a day.",0

283,"In her quest for revenge and pride, Ronda Rousey lost her own way",".Rousey, the UFC women's bantamweight champion, has been the face of the sport for more than a decade, but she has never won a world title. She is the first woman to win a title in two different weight classes, and she is also the only woman in UFC history to hold two titles in the same weight class. But she hasn't been able to make it to the top of any of those divisions. In fact, she's been knocked out in three of her last four fights, including a first-round knockout loss to Holly Holm at UFC 193 earlier this year. That's not to mention the fact that she lost to Miesha Tate in her most recent fight, a decision that was overturned to a no-contest after the Nevada State Athletic Commission ruled that Tate had used a banned substance in a post-fight drug test. The loss was the second time in less than two years that a UFC fighter has lost a fight to an opponent who tested positive for banned substances. Tate was suspended for six months and fined $50,000 by the NSAC for her use of an anabolic steroid, which was later found to have been contaminated with the banned stimulant stanozolol. It was also revealed that her husband, UFC president Dana White, was aware of Tate's positive test and did nothing to stop her from using the substance. Rousimar Palhares, another former UFC light heavyweight champion who lost his title to Tate, is currently on the sidelines with a knee injury and is expected to be out of action for at least a few months, if not longer. ""Rowdy"" has also been plagued by injuries in recent years, most notably a torn ACL in his right knee that forced him to retire from mixed martial arts competition in 2013. He has since returned to MMA competition, where he has won two of his last three fights. However, he still has a long way to go before he is considered a legitimate contender for the title he once held.",0

 the Turkish army has launched a military operation in northern Syria, targeting PKK/PYD terror group's positions in Qamishli and Afrin cantons. The operation is being carried out with the support of the US-led anti-ISIL coalition, which has been providing air support to the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in their fight against the Islamic State (IS) group in Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor governorates. Turkey, a NATO member, considers the PYD and its armed wing, the People's Protection Units (YPG), to be terrorists because of their affiliation with outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is listed as a terrorist organization by the U.S., the EU, and Turkey. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that the operation would continue until ""terrorists"" are removed from Turkey's borders. ""We are going to continue this operation until we remove the terrorists from our borders,"" he said, adding that Turkey would not tolerate any attempt to create a ""terrorist state"" in its southern border region. In a televised speech, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said Turkey had ""no other choice"" but to take action against PKK and YPG militants in Syria. He added that Ankara would ""continue to support the SDF and the Free Syrian Army (FSA) as long as they do not cross the border into Turkish territory."" Turkey has long been accused of not doing enough to stop the flow of foreign fighters and weapons into Syria and Iraq, where they have been linked to terrorist groups such as IS and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly known as Al-Nusra Front). The Turkish government has also been criticized for failing to prevent the smuggling of oil from IS-controlled areas into Turkey via the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon, as well as the illegal trade of antiquities from Syria's Palmyra to Turkey through the city of Gaziantep on the Mediterranean coast.

6965,Nonprofit Working To Block Drug Imports Has Ties To Pharma Lobby,"The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) are both funded by the pharmaceutical industry, according to the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP), a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit organization that tracks money in politics. The two agencies have a combined budget of more than $1.5 billion and are responsible for regulating the importation and distribution of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs in the United States. According to CRP, the OTC market for prescription drugs is estimated to be worth $2.2 billion annually. In addition, NIDA's budget for drug research and development (R&D) is approximately $3.6 billion, and it is the only federal agency with the authority to approve or deny drug applications for use in human clinical trials. Both agencies also have ties to pharmaceutical companies.

ODDCP's board of directors is made up of representatives from both the AMA and AAPS, along with representatives of several other industry groups, such as American Hospital Association, American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).

(Photo: Courtesy of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension) Story Highlights The shooting was captured on a dashboard camera and dashcam video from the officer's squad car, according to the state attorney general's office, which is handling the case. The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave, pending the outcome of an investigation by the BCA.
Castile's girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, told the St. Paul Pioneer Press that he was reaching for his license and registration at the time of his death. She said he told her he had a permit to carry a gun and that the gun was legally registered to him. Reynolds said she was with him the entire time, and he never pointed a weapon at her.

 the video shows the moments leading up to and following the fatal shooting. It also shows Reynolds' account of what happened, as well as that of her boyfriend, who told police he heard a ""pop"" and saw a man reach into his pocket and pull out what appeared to be a handgun. He said the man told him to ""get the (expletive) out of my face"" before pulling out the weapon and shooting him multiple times.The video does not show the moment of impact, but it does show a moment after the shots were fired, when Reynolds can be heard saying, ""Oh my God, he just shot me in my stomach,"" and ""I can't believe he did that to me."" The video then cuts to a shot of Reynolds lying on the ground, with her hands over her head.She was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she died a short time later.In a statement, the Minneapolis Police Department said: ""We are deeply saddened by this tragic loss of life. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Reynolds family during this difficult time. We are conducting a thorough investigation into this incident",0

57,Mississippi's only abortion clinic sues state after governor signs nation's most restrictive abortion law,"A federal judge in Mississippi has blocked the state from enforcing a law that would have required doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital within 30 miles of the clinic where they perform abortions.
U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves ruled that the law, which was passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature and signed into law by Republican Gov. Phil Bryant, violates the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech and the right to free exercise of religion. The law also requires abortion clinics to meet the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers and requires doctors who perform the procedure to be certified by a medical board that is not affiliated with the Mississippi Medical Association, Reeves wrote in his ruling on Monday. He also said the requirement that doctors be able to provide abortion care within a 30-mile radius of their clinic violates a provision in the federal Family Medical Leave Act that allows employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a newborn or a seriously ill family member. Reeves said he would issue a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of those provisions. A hearing on the injunction is scheduled for Wednesday. ""This is a major victory for women's health and safety,"" said Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, in a statement. She called the ruling ""an important step toward ensuring that Mississippi women have access to safe and legal abortion services."" The lawsuit was brought by Mississippi Right to Life and Mississippi Alliance for Life, both of which are based in Jackson, Mississippi. Both groups said they would appeal the judge's ruling to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, where the case is being heard. In addition to Reeves, the court also heard arguments from attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi and a coalition of abortion rights groups, including NARAL Pro-Choice America and National Advocates for Pregnant Women, as well as the Center for Reproductive Rights.",0

1413,Tom Brady wins third NFL MVP; Rams' Todd Gurley finishes second,"By Sam Monson • Oct 24, 2016
.
, the NFL's reigning MVP, has been named the league's top player for the third year in a row, according to NFL.com's Ian Rapoport.The New England Patriots quarterback is the first player in NFL history to win three MVP awards in the same season, joining Peyton Manning, Tom Brady and Drew Brees as the only players to accomplish the feat.Brady, who has led the Patriots to the AFC East title in each of the past two seasons, is now just one win away from tying the record for most MVP wins by a quarterback, set by Manning in 2007.In addition to winning his third MVP award, Brady also finished second in total yards, passing for a career-high 4,717 yards and 31 touchdowns. He also rushed for 1,845 yards on the ground, which was the second-highest single-season total in league history behind Manning's record-setting 2011 campaign.New England's defense, led by defensive tackle Vince Wilfork and linebacker Dont'a Hightower, was also a major factor in Brady's success this season. The Patriots finished the regular season with the best defensive DVOA (defense-adjusted value over average) in franchise history, allowing just 17.3 points per game. They also allowed just four touchdowns, tied for second fewest in team history.Defensive end Chandler Jones, linebacker Jamie Collins and safety Devin McCourty were also key contributors to New York's Super Bowl XLIX victory over the Seattle Seahawks.Jones, a three-time Pro Bowler, finished with 10.5 sacks, while Collins added 8.0 sacks and a pair of forced fumbles.McCourty, an eight-year NFL veteran, recorded his first career interception and forced fumble in his second game back from a four-game absence due to a torn pectoral muscle.He also returned an interception 51 yards to set up a touchdown, and was credited with a pass breakup on a third-down pass intended for tight end Rob Gronkowski that was returned by cornerback Malcolm Butler for an 80-yard touchdown to give the Pats a 14-10 lead with just over three minutes remaining in regulation.Collins, meanwhile, had a team-leading six pass breakups, including a pick-six in overtime against the New Orleans Saints in Week 17 that helped the Giants win the NFC Championship Game.HIGHTOWER was a key contributor on both defense and special teams, as he recorded three interceptions and returned two for touchdowns during the postseason.",0

5383,"French nursing home workers protest job shortages, cost cuts"," and poor working conditions at a rally in Madrid, Spain, on Wednesday. (Photo: Josep Lago, AP)Spain's unemployment rate rose to a record high of 26.6% in the first quarter of this year, according to the National Statistics Institute. That's up from 25.8% a year earlier and the highest rate since the country joined the European Union in 1981. The jobless rate is now higher than in Greece, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain — all of which have been in recession for more than two years. Unemployment is also higher in Spain than it is in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Austria. Spain's economy shrank by 0.2% last quarter, its first contraction in three years, and is expected to contract by 1.5% this quarter.
... and it's not over yet: The Spanish economy is projected to shrink by 2.3% next year. But the government is hoping that a new round of austerity measures, including tax hikes and spending cuts, will help it avoid a full-blown recession. If that happens, unemployment could fall to 25% by the end of the decade, down from the current level of 27.4%. The International Monetary Fund predicts that Spain will need to cut its deficit to 3.1% of gross domestic product in 2013, from 4.7% now, in order to meet the EU's deficit-reduction target of 3% for 2013 and 2014. ""It's going to be a tough year for Spain,"" said Jose Ignacio Torreblanca, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York, noting that the economy has been hit by a drop in oil prices, a weaker euro and a weak euro-dollar exchange rate, which makes Spanish exports more expensive for U.S. buyers. Still, he said, ""I don't think it will be as bad as it looks at the moment."" The government has already announced plans to raise the retirement age to 67 from 62 and cut the number of public-sector jobs by 10% over the next four years in an effort to reduce the budget deficit. It's also considering raising the minimum wage to €8 an hour from €6.50, as well as raising taxes on the wealthy and reducing the value-added tax, or VAT, that businesses pay on goods and services they sell to consumers",0

I am not sure how to respond to this, but I think it is important to note that this is not the first time this has happened to me. In fact, it seems to be happening more and more often, and I am starting to wonder if it might be a symptom of some sort of mental illness, or maybe just the result of a lack of self-confidence. the problem is that I have no idea what to say to someone who has just told me that they are not going to help me with my problem. It is like they have just said, ""I'm not a doctor, so I won't be able to tell you what is wrong with you."" I feel like I should be saying something like ""You need to talk to your doctor about this,"" or something along those lines. But instead, I'm just trying to explain to them that it's not their job to fix my problems. They are the ones who have to take care of me, not me the person. This is something I've been struggling with for a while now.I have been having a lot of trouble with depression and anxiety for the past few years. For a long time I thought I was the only one who was having these problems, because I didn't seem to have any friends or family members who were suffering from the same thing. However, as I got older I started to realize that there were other people like me out there, people who had the exact same problems as me and were just not getting the help they needed. So I decided to start a blog to share my experiences and to try to get some help for myself and others who are going through similar things.The first post on the blog was about a friend of mine who I had been seeing for about six months. She had just been diagnosed with a serious illness and was in the process of getting treatment for it. At the time, she was living with her boyfriend, who she had met through a mutual friend. He was a really nice guy and she really liked him. We had a great time together and it seemed like everything was going well until one day he started acting really weird and acting like he wasn't interested in her anymore. When she asked him why he was acting that way, he told her that he had gotten into an argument with his girlfriend about something and that she should just leave him alone. The next day, when she tried to call him, his phone was off and he wouldn't pick up the phone. After a few days of this he finally called her and apologized for his behavior and said he wanted to see her again. Unfortunately, the next time she called him he hung up on her before she could even finish her sentence.When I asked her what had happened she said that the boyfriend had threatened to beat her up if she ever told anyone about what he did to her. That was when I realized that my friend was not alone in this. Many of my friends and family have had similar experiences with their boyfriends, husbands, fathers, brothers, uncles, cousins, etc. All of these people have either been physically or verbally abused by their partners or husbands or fathers or brothers or cousins. Some of them have even had to leave their homes because they were afraid of what would happen if they reported what was happening to their families or friends.This is a problem that is very common in our society. People are afraid to speak up about their problems because of the stigma that comes with being a victim of domestic violence or sexual assault. If they do speak out about it, they will be accused of being ""crazy"" or ""mentally ill"" and will often be shunned by the people they care about the most. There is also the fact that many people are scared to come forward for fear of losing their jobs, being ostracized from their communities, having their children taken away from them, losing custody of their own children or even being killed in an accident.There are many reasons why people do not report their abuse to the police or the authorities. First of all, there is the fear that if you do, you will lose your job, your family and even your life. Secondly, many victims of abuse are too ashamed to report it to anyone at all. Thirdly, some victims are so traumatized by what they went through that no one will believe them. And finally, most people just want to keep their lives as normal as possible so they can continue to live their normal lives and not",0

3381,Israel: Netanyahu corruption probe in 'final stretch',"JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israeli prime minister's office says it is investigating allegations of corruption against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, in connection with a real estate deal in the West Bank. The probe is in ""the final stretch,"" the office said in a statement Friday. It did not say when the probe would be completed. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and said he will cooperate with the investigation. He has not been charged with any crime. Sara Netanyahu, who is also the wife of Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon, is not under investigation, the statement said. A spokesman for the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, told The Associated Press on Friday that he could not comment on an ongoing investigation and referred all questions to the Israeli police. ""The investigation is ongoing,"" he said, adding that the police had not yet received a request for an arrest warrant from the Attorney General's Office, which is handling the case. Israel has a long-standing practice of prosecuting high-level officials for corruption, but the practice has been criticized by human rights groups and the United Nations as a violation of the right to a fair trial. In recent years, a number of prominent Israeli politicians have been arrested on corruption charges, including former prime ministers Ehud Olmert and Ariel Sharon, as well as former foreign minister Avigdor Liberman and former justice minister Tzipi Livni.",0

1113,UN envoy: 'The State of Israel is here to stay',"Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, told the Security Council on Tuesday that the ""state of emergency"" declared in the West Bank and East Jerusalem ""is not a temporary measure, it is a permanent one."" He added that Israel would continue to defend itself and its citizens from attacks by Palestinians and other ""terrorists"" and that it would not accept a Palestinian state in any of the territories it has occupied since the 1967 Middle East war. ""We are not going to give up our right to live in peace and security in our homeland,"" he said in a speech at the UN headquarters in New York. He said Israel was prepared to take ""all necessary measures"" to protect itself, including the use of force if necessary, but that ""we will not be deterred from defending ourselves and our citizens."" The resolution, which passed by a vote of 15-0, calls on the Palestinians to ""immediately and completely cease all acts of violence, incitement and all other acts that undermine the two-state solution."" It also calls for an immediate end to Israeli settlement building in occupied territory, and for the resumption of direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinians have said they will only recognize Israel as a Jewish state if Israel agrees to withdraw to pre-1967 lines and recognize the right of return of Palestinian refugees to their homes and property in Israel. Israel has insisted that any peace deal must also include a halt to all settlement activity. In a statement, the U.N. secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, said he was ""deeply concerned"" by the vote and called on all sides ""to exercise restraint and refrain from any actions that could further inflame tensions."" ""I urge all parties to exercise maximum restraint, to avoid any steps that might further escalate the situation,"" Ban said, adding that he had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas by telephone and would do so again on Wednesday. Ban also called for a ""comprehensive and immediate"" investigation into the incident in which an Israeli settler was shot and killed by Palestinian protesters in Jerusalem's Old City on Monday night, saying it was an ""unacceptable escalation"" that had ""no place in an open and democratic society."" In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Netanyahu said the violence was the result of ""incitement"" on both sides and said ""the only way to solve the problem is through negotiations."" Netanyahu, who has been under pressure from his right-wing coalition partners to condemn the attack, added: ""It's not the first time that we've seen this kind of thing. We have seen it before. It's a matter of time before it happens again. I'm sure it won't be the last time."" On Tuesday, a senior Israeli official told CNN that Netanyahu would meet with Abbas in Ramallah on Thursday to discuss the crisis. Netanyahu's spokesman, Mark Regev, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the prime minister planned to meet Abbas. On Monday, Israeli police shot dead an 18-year-old Palestinian man after he allegedly stabbed and seriously wounded a Border Police officer at a bus stop near the Jerusalem-Judea and Samaria border crossing, police said. A second Palestinian was arrested in connection with the stabbing and was being held in police custody on suspicion of murder, according to police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. Palestinian officials have accused Israel of using excessive force against Palestinians during the wave of unrest that began in October. Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians, most of them attackers, since October, when a series of stabbings, shootings and car-rammings claimed the lives of 29 Israelis, two visiting Americans and a British citizen. More than 100 Israelis have also been killed in Palestinian attacks and clashes with security forces.",0

In one such case, a man was found hanging from a tree in his village. He had a debt of Rs. 1.5 lakh, which he had not paid for a long time. His family members said that he did not want to go to jail, so he decided to take his own life by hanging himself. The police were called, and the body was taken to the hospital, where it was discovered that the man had hanged himself with a piece of cloth tied around his neck. It was later found out that his debt had been paid off in a few days. However, his family was not informed of his death. They were not even allowed to bury his body. This is a very common occurrence in our country. I am sure that you will be able to understand why I feel so strongly about this issue.)
